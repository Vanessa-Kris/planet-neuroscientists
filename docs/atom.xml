		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-first-map-solar-corona-magnetic-field"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090602</id>
		<updated>2020-08-21T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The sun’s wispy upper atmosphere, called the corona, is an ever-changing jungle of sizzling plasma. But mapping the strength of the magnetic fields that largely control that behavior has proved elusive. The fields are weak and the brightness of the sun outshines its corona.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now though, observations taken using a specialized instrument called a coronagraph to block out the sun’s bright disk have allowed solar physicists to measure the speed and intensity of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hotter-sun&quot;&gt;waves rippling through coronal plasma&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/19/09&lt;/em&gt;). “This is the first time we’ve mapped the coronal magnetic field on a large scale,” says Steven Tomczyk, a solar physicist at the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colo., who designed the coronagraph.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Tomczyk had been part of a team that took advantage of a total solar eclipse crisscrossing North America to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-solar-magnetic-field&quot;&gt;take measurements of the corona’s magnetic field&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/16/17&lt;/em&gt;). He trekked to a mountaintop in Wyoming with a special camera to snap polarized pictures of the corona just as the moon blocked the sun.  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wyoming-eclipse-physics-corona&quot;&gt;I was there with them&lt;/a&gt;, reporting on the team’s efforts to help explain why the corona is so much hotter than the sun’s surface (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/21/17&lt;/em&gt;).) The team observed a tiny slice of the corona to test whether a particular wavelength of light could carry signatures of the corona’s magnetic field. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/five-things-learned-great-american-eclipse&quot;&gt;It can&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/21/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it’s the observations from the coronagraph, made in 2016, that allowed researchers to look at the whole corona all at once. Theorists had shown decades ago that coronal waves’ velocities can be used to infer the strength of the magnetic field. Such waves might also help &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils&quot;&gt;carry heat from the sun’s surface into the corona&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/14/19&lt;/em&gt;). But no one had measured them across the whole corona before.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The corona’s magnetic field &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6504/694&quot;&gt;strength is mostly between 1 and 4 gauss&lt;/a&gt;, a few times the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field at the planet’s surface, the researchers report in the Aug. 7 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making a map is a big step, the team says. But what solar physicists would really like to do is track the corona’s magnetic field continuously, at least once a day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The solar magnetic field is evolving all the time,” says solar physicist Zihao Yang of Peking University in Beijing. Sometimes the sun releases magnetic energy explosively, sending &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronal-mass-ejection-magnetic-sun-plasma-eruption&quot;&gt;bursts of plasma can shooting out into space&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/7/19&lt;/em&gt;). Those ejections can wreak havoc on satellites or power grids when they strike Earth. Continuously monitoring coronal magnetism can help predict those outbursts. “Our work demonstrated that we can use this technique to map the global distribution of coronal magnetic field, but we only showed one map from a single dataset,” Yang says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measuring the strength of the corona’s magnetic field is “a really big deal,” says solar physicist Jenna Samra of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. “Making global maps of the coronal magnetic field strength … is what’s going to allow us to eventually get better predictions of space weather events,” she says. “This is a really nice step in that direction.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tomczyk and colleagues are working on an upgraded version of the coronagraph, called COSMO, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.hao.ucar.edu/cosmo&quot;&gt;Coronal Solar Magnetism Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, that would use the same technique repeatedly with the ultimate goal of predicting the sun’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a milestone to do it,” Tomczyk says. “The goal is to do it regularly, do it all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/board-game-endangered-conservation"/>

		<updated>2020-08-21T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Saving endangered species isn’t easy. Doing so requires the cooperation of many people — from scientists and conservation organizations to governments and local residents — as well as a bit of luck. That’s as true in real life as it is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://grandgamersguild.com/shop/endangered/&quot;&gt;Endangered&lt;/a&gt;, a new board game from Grand Gamers Guild.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Endangered is a cooperative game for one to five players. Each person takes on a role — zoologist, philanthropist, lobbyist, environmental lawyer or TV wildlife show host — and players work together to convince at least four ambassadors to save a species. (In a one-player game, two roles are played simultaneously.) If you get too few “yes” votes, or let habitat destruction spread too much, or if your animal population dies out, everyone loses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The game starts with a set of animals in their habitat, either tigers or sea otters, depending on which of the game’s two story lines you play. Each player’s turn consists of a series of phases. In the first, a player takes actions, such as moving animals to let them mate or obtaining money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the offspring phase, animal reproduction is controlled by the role of a die. The die also controls where habitation destruction — either deforestation or pollution — spreads. A card draw then brings on other events, from clear-cutting of forests to a shark attack to an animal rescue.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After each player takes a turn, the year ends. And after a set number of years, the ambassadors are consulted. Each ambassador has a different preset list of conditions that must be met to vote “yes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The game is modular, and each story line has its own challenges and adorable, animal-shaped wooden meeples. (A third story line, &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.grandgamersguild.com/products/the-great-panda-for-endangered&quot;&gt;giant pandas&lt;/a&gt;, is available in an expansion pack, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/endangerednewspecies/endangered-new-species?ref=68tycu&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; that began this month is raising funds for additional animal packs.) Each story line has three levels of difficulty, which, combined with the multiple role-playing options, provide plenty of variety throughout multiple plays of the game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while the game is fairly simple to set up and learn, winning proved deceptively difficult. Just when I thought I’d get enough ambassadors on my side, I found myself losing all my tigers or awash in pollution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The game’s scenarios, while simplified, recognize real-world problems for these animals. Poachers and habitat fragmentation indeed threaten tigers, just as oil spills and &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii &lt;/em&gt;parasites endanger sea otters. “I wanted a theme that players can relate to, something engaging and emotional,” says Joe Hopkins, the game’s designer. Endangered’s publisher, Marc Specter, notes that the game’s developers consulted with the Center for Biological Diversity to ensure scientific accuracy. And Specter says he plans on donating some of the profits from Endangered to the nonprofit organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there is any downside to the game, it’s that Endangered can never hope to encompass the truly vast scope of the extinction problem. A study published in the June 16 &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, for example, estimates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/24/13596&quot;&gt;515 land-dwelling vertebrate species&lt;/a&gt; alone are on the brink of extinction. And scientists have warned that the planet is in the midst of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racing-extinction-documents-plight-endangered-species&quot;&gt;sixth mass extinction&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/14/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Endangered does hold an important lesson for how to move forward. Saving species is not something that scientists or philanthropists or lawyers or any other single group can do on its own. Only by working together do we have any chance of success.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Egyptian animal mummies can look like little more than bundles of cloth. Now high-tech X-rays have unveiled the mysterious life histories of three of these mummies — a cat, a bird and a snake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While 2-D X-rays of each specimen existed, little information existed beyond generic animal labels. So Richard Johnston, an engineer at Swansea University in Wales, and his colleagues used a microCT scanner to see what lies beneath the wraps of animal mummies at the university’s Museum of Egyptian Antiquities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;digital image of a scan of a cat's head&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090594&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081920_ht_animal-mummies_inline_680-453x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090594&quot;&gt;The mummified cat’s head (seen in this 3-D model created from microCT data) was separated from the body after death. The skull may also have been dropped at some point, creating more fractures postmortem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090594&quot;&gt;Swansea University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bone scans of three of those specimens provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69726-0&quot;&gt;such detail that researchers could identify&lt;/a&gt; the cat as a domestic kitten (&lt;em&gt;Felis catus&lt;/em&gt;), the bird as a Eurasian kestrel (&lt;em&gt;Falco tinnunculus&lt;/em&gt;) and the snake as an Egyptian cobra (&lt;em&gt;Naja haje&lt;/em&gt;), the team reports August 20 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. Cause of death was clear in two of the cases: The kitten was strangled, and the snake had its neck broken. The snake also suffered from kidney damage, possibly a result of water deprivation near the end of its life. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/animal-mummies-were-message-direct-gods&quot;&gt;many of Egypt’s mummified animals&lt;/a&gt;, these three may have served as offerings to Egyptian gods (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/6/14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Focusing on sections instead of just scanning the whole mummy at once allowed the team to get increased detail and create models of the mummified remains that could be 3-D printed and investigated through virtual reality. “With VR, I can effectively make the cat skull as big as my house and wander around it,” Johnston says. That’s how the team found the kitten’s unerupted molars, a clue that the animal was under five months old.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That novel approach to microCT scanning mummies definitely has potential, says Lidija McKnight, an archaeologist at the University of Manchester in England who was not affiliated with the study.  “These advanced techniques are extremely powerful tools to improve our understanding of this ancient practice.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scans hint at Egyptian ritual in the snake, which had rock structures in its open mouth, possibly the mineral natron used by ancient Egyptians to slow decomposition. Ancient embalmers often &lt;a href=&quot;https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.23140&quot;&gt;opened the mouths and eyes&lt;/a&gt; of mummies so the dead could see and communicate with the living, but previously this kind of procedure had primarily been seen in human mummies. Snakes, it appears, may have also whispered beyond the grave, serving as a messenger between the gods and a worshipper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peering inside animal mummies with a microCT scanner section by section allowed researchers to create intricate 3-D models with a level of detail that might have been lost through other imaging methods.&lt;/figure&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;For its last meal, an ancient marine reptile called an ichthyosaur may have bitten off more than it could chew.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dolphinlike creature was nearly 5 meters long, about the length of a canoe. And its belly contained the remains of a lizardlike reptile called a thalattosaur that was almost as long: 4 meters. This is the longest known prey of a marine reptile from the dinosaur age, and may be the oldest direct evidence of a marine reptile eating an animal larger than a human, researchers report August 20 in &lt;em&gt;iScience&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, this particular thalattosaur may have been such a big meal that the ichthyosaur died after stomaching it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ichthyosaur’s blunt teeth suggest it should have favored &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-ichthyosaurs-last-meal-revealed&quot;&gt;small, soft prey like cephalopods&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/3/17&lt;/em&gt;). “Now we have really solid evidence saying these [blunt] teeth can be used to eat something big,” says Ryosuke Motani, a paleobiologist at the University of California, Davis. “That means the other species with similar teeth we discounted before … may be megapredators too.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Motani and colleagues examined the nearly complete skeleton of an adult ichthyosaur that was unearthed in southwestern China in 2010. The reptile, from the genus &lt;em&gt;Guizhouichthyosaurus&lt;/em&gt;, lived during the Triassic Period about 240 million years ago. Upon closer inspection of a big lump of bones in the creature’s belly, Motani’s team discovered that the last thing the ichthyosaur ate was the body of a thalattosaur, sans head and tail. The thalattosaur remains show little evidence of being degraded by stomach acid, suggesting the ichthyosaur died shortly after its enormous meal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These fossils provide “pretty good evidence that the bigger animal ate the smaller one,” says vertebrate paleontologist Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study. “If this really is the case, it’s quite stunning,” because the predator was not much larger than its prey — at least in terms of length. The ichthyosaur is thought to have been roughly seven times more massive than the whip-thin thalattosaur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ichthyosaur illustration&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090588&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081920_mt_ichthyosaur_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090588&quot;&gt;A 5-meter-long ichthyosaur chowed down on the body of a 4-meter-long thalattosaur, minus the prey’s head and tail, as seen in this illustration. The previous record-holder for longest prey of a dinosaur-age marine reptile was a mere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090588&quot;&gt;D.-Y. Jiang et al/&lt;em&gt;iScience&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the ichthyosaur most likely hunted, rather than scavenged, its meal. For one thing, it would have been unusual to come across a whole dead animal that no other predator had gobbled up, and the ichthyosaur would have had to shovel down the huge meal on the seafloor — tough for an air-breathing creature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plus, the thalattosaur’s limbs were still at least partially attached to its body, while its tail was uncovered about 20 meters away. Studies of how bodies decompose underwater suggest that if the thalattosaur was a carcass when the ichthyosaur found it, the prey’s limbs would have rotted off before its tail, the authors argue. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Motani suspects that killing and eating the thalattosaur may have spelled the ichthyosaur’s demise. The ichthyosaur’s fossilized body and head, while well preserved, are detached from one another, hinting that the animal may have died of a broken neck. The ichthyosaur could have injured its neck while holding the thalattosaur in its jaws and thrashing its head, which is how crocodiles and killer whales rip up their food without particularly sharp teeth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ichthyosaur also could have hurt itself while swallowing such large prey. “This is not a snake that’s adapted to swallow something really big, so it has to swallow just like dolphins and crocodiles do,” Motani says. That means swimming against its prey to shove the food down its throat, or sticking its head above water and using gravity to gulp the meal down. “It could easily damage its neck doing this.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soviet research in Antarctica&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/soviet-research-antarctica&quot;&gt;Science News&lt;/a&gt;, August 22 &amp;amp; 29, 1970 —&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a hypothesis that the Great Antarctic [Ice] Shield is gradually sliding into the sea at a rate of about 330 feet a year.… To learn how much ice is accumulated and how much of it slides off the continent, scientists set up special survey stakes…. During their latest trek they checked these survey stakes and determined the speed with which the ice masses creep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Satellite monitoring that began in the early 1990s has let scientists precisely measure how fast ice moves across Antarctica. Ice near the heart of the continent today creeps coastward at less than 10 meters per year, while ice close to the coast picks up the pace, traveling up to a few kilometers per year. Due to global warming, Antarctica is losing ice faster than it can be replaced. From 2012 to 2017, the continent shed an average of about 219 billion metric tons of ice annually, compared with 76 billion tons per year during the previous two decades. Overall, Antarctic ice melt from 1992 to 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-lost-3-trillion-metric-tons-ice-since-1992-sea-level-rise&quot;&gt;boosted global sea level by 7.6 millimeters on average&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/7/18, p. 6&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Dogs are much more than just pets. With an innately acute sense of smell up to 100,000 times greater than ours, dogs can be trained to detect not only drugs and explosives but also the scent of individuals with cancer, malaria and other diseases. Now, as this pilot &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05281-3/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; shows, they can also be trained to detect those with coronavirus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12087 alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/neil-fedorowycz-hHCDldR1ZcQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Prof. Holger Volk and colleagues at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover presented dogs with samples from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive or –negative nasopharyngeal swabs taken from symptomatic COVID-19 patients or healthy controls. Samples were presented in a randomized, automated and blinded manner and dogs were rewarded with a treat or ball when a positive sample was successfully sniffed out. After only seven days of training, the cohort of eight dogs achieved an average detection rate of 94%, with 157 correctly identified positive samples, 792 rejected negative samples and only 33 false positives and 30 false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This remarkable ability likely relies on the different patterns of volatile compounds given off by infected cells compared to uninfected cells in the body. This preliminary study helps to pave the way for larger trials on the use of dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be particularly useful in countries with limited access to lab-based diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12015 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/postit-240x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;182&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our lives seemingly getting busier and busier, our health can suffer. In their recently published study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Mensah and Adjei look at how gender and the level of welfare provision by the state impact the association between work-life balance and self-reported health. The results of the study indicate that the impact of a poor work-life balance on health is generally more pronounced in women, apart from in Conservative states (such as Germany and Switzerland) where the effect is greater in men. States with welfare regimes that are considered Conservative or Liberal (i.e. the UK and Ireland) show the strongest association between work-life conflict and poor health, which the authors suggest may be a result of differences in employment regulation, weaker trade unions and less generous provision of state welfare than other countries such as the Nordic states. The findings of this study show that governments and policymakers must carefully consider how working practices and state welfare policies differentially affect women and men’s health.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-01072-1/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;The influence of social media on recruitment to surgical trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is more connected than ever thanks to social media, but what role might it play in medical and surgical research? &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-01072-1/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; asks whether Twitter is effective as a tool to aid recruitment to surgical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12088 alignright&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/charles-deluvio-FdDkfYFHqe4-unsplash-300x291.jpg&quot; width=&quot;212&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators for the Emergency Laparotomy and Frailty (ELF) Study set up a Twitter handle (@ELFStudy) to promote site registration in preparation for the trial and to promote patient recruitment once the trial commenced. The authors tracked engagement with their tweets over time and found that an increased number of tweets over time correlated with increased patient recruitment, with each individual tweet associated with an additional 1.66 patients recruited. The authors propose that their eye-catching branding (in this case Christmas themed thanks to the study’s acronym!) enabled them to engage with their target audience and ‘market’ the trial, allowing them to reach their intended recruitment target in half the time predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Geriatrics – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01564-1/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Interventions to improve appropriate antibiotic prescribing in long-term care facilities: a systematic review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most promising interventions involved persuasion, enablement, feedback on behavior and restructuring of the social environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance is emerging as a major public health problem and is particularly worrying in long-term care facilities for older adults, where residents are vulnerable to serious infections and poor outcomes. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Clayton &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;systematically review antimicrobial stewardship interventions, which aim to reduce overuse of antibiotics, and assess the types of behavior change techniques associated with positive outcomes. Of over 10,000 records initially screened, the authors assess 72 articles for eligibility with only 20 of those suitable for in-depth analysis. In the majority of those 20 studies, the behavior targeted was antibiotic prescribing by healthcare professionals. The most promising interventions involved persuasion, enablement, feedback on behavior and restructuring of the social environment, for example assigning a staff member as an antimicrobial stewardship champion. The least promising interventions, on the other hand, used problem solving techniques or provided feedback on outcomes of behavior, such as local antimicrobial resistance patterns. The results of this secondary analysis may help to guide the design or refinement of interventions to tackle antibiotic resistance in this community setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Plant Biology – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-020-02552-8/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;iTRAQ protein profile analysis of sugar beet under salt stress: different coping mechanisms in leaves and roots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12094 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/shahan-khan-WyIsEBjuhKg-unsplash-scaled-e1597749164531-270x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;189&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High salt levels can cause osmotic, nutritional and metabolic stress in plants, leading to poor crop yield and poor crop quality. Some plants, such as sugar beet – an important source of sucrose – have evolved tolerance mechanisms to cope with salt stress. In this article in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Plant Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; use quantitative proteomics to study salt stress coping mechanisms in different parts of the sugar beet plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both leaves and roots were sampled from plants grown in high salt vs. control conditions, with global changes in protein levels profiled in these samples by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, 70 and 76 differentially abundant proteins were identified in leaves and roots respectively, only three of which were found in both sample types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidation-reduction was found to be the most enriched biological process in the salt-regulated proteome in both leaves and roots, highlighting a potential role for redox homeostasis in stress tolerance. However, the precise molecular and metabolic pathways up- and down-regulated by salt stress were largely different between leaves and roots, suggesting that the two plant organs exploit different coping mechanisms. An understanding of these mechanisms may prove useful in future efforts to promote stress tolerance in commercially important crops like sugar beet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Psychiatry – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-02776-w/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Patient and befriender experiences of participating in a befriending programme for adults with psychosis: a qualitative study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Befriending, whereby volunteers provide support and companionship for individuals living with mental or physical illnesses, can help to reduce symptoms, reduce social isolation and improve quality of life. Befriending programmes may be particularly beneficial for individuals with psychosis, who commonly experience social isolation. However, such programmes can be difficult to implement and outcomes can be mixed. This qualitative study, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, looks at the experiences of both befrienders and patients who took part in a befriending programme for individuals with psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors highlight several key themes in their data from interviews with participants. Both volunteers and patients reported that befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society, challenging befrienders’ false preconceptions about psychosis. However, some volunteers also reported that the commitment was greater than anticipated and both befrienders and patients said that a flexible approach was required to meet the individual needs of those taking part. Studies such as this one help to recognize and maximize the benefits of befriending whilst also acknowledging its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Arnett describes &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199929382.001.0001/acprof-9780199929382&quot;&gt;emerging adulthood&lt;/a&gt; as a distinct stage of development from the late teens through the twenties; a life stage in which explorations and instability are the norm. As they focus on their self-development, emerging adults feel in-between, on the way to adulthood but not there yet. Nevertheless, they have a high level of optimism about what the future holds for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current climate, emerging adults are facing more instability than ever before. Whether it’s starting university, forging new relationships, or entering the job market – the uncertainty surrounding these milestones has presented many new challenges, and exacerbated the more common anxieties of adjusting to change. We’ve put together a reading list of books that address some of the key issues facing emerging adults – in areas such as education, work, relationships, and mental health – and provide advice and approaches for managing this turbulent stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mood-prep-101-9780190914301&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Prep 101: A Parent’s Guide to Preventing Depression and Anxiety in College-Bound Teens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Carol Landau&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book answers the question most parents have – “What can we do?” – when it comes to college-bound teens who may be vulnerable to anxiety and depression. This timely book empowers parents by providing strategies for helping their children psychologically prepare for college and adulthood, as well as by addressing and alleviating the anxiety parents themselves may feel about kids leaving home for the first time. Landau shows parents how they can promote healthy communication and problem-solving skills, and how they can help young people learn to better regulate emotions and tolerate distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;408&quot; src=&quot;https://d1pawtlfzz7188.cloudfront.net/60fafaa33598a1337dec1988d6b2b205e4f5afc8fe35371270bc309699f96bf0/EU7D-9nEPVo.jpg?response-content-disposition=inline&amp;amp;Expires=1597332007&amp;amp;Signature=SXf8uEz8myKuqHlBLgClWW+G8TKK7TVXOHfJbqG9kk4llzm8IRJBjQ94rVp0mmB/D7on4h1u9kSNivVLy8eDlLv5RQS17/QsvsnbswWEhejZ2QP/oJ1x0wuyH/1UswcF48Xa2yP9als7Huv+94mHpXo0i8R7L8F6UXuyCE2iGw3Md6F+wHLX+if+FblEwCEV4dfZ8++DR5kgDZ6CsimN8YTBGi538phOrug9biJAOeZpxHcL1K4dLPFXuhJ1Qwt4of4VzkknlgFTYivA5l84vM1n7VGg72BIfbkC+iWqV7T75dD0JZMjERo6qqVbPpF+NYJNUcgwNxfXR4lBGrDDpw==&amp;amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJAX54V4IT7A2GGEA&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cognitive-skills-you-need-for-the-21st-century-9780197529003&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Skills You Need for the 21st Century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Reed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can young people today prepare for the workplace of the future? Stephen Reed discusses a Future of Jobs report that contrasts trending and declining skills required by the workforce in the year 2022. Trending skills include analytical thinking and innovation, active learning strategies, creativity, reasoning, and complex problem solving. This book aids undergraduate and graduate students in planning their education by recommending courses and projects that will help them to gain important 21st century skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mindfulness-for-the-next-generation-9780190905156&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness for the Next Generation: Helping Emerging Adults Manage Stress and Lead Healthier Lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Holly Rogers and Margaret Maytan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;College students and other emerging adults today experience high levels of stress as they pursue personal, educational, and career goals.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of all “cross-modal” findings, the most famous is surely the bouba-kiki effect — that we tend to pair round, blobby shapes with the sound &lt;em&gt;bouba&lt;/em&gt; and spiky shapes with &lt;em&gt;kiki&lt;/em&gt;. However, research has not yet revealed why this effect is common among adults who speak very different languages — and even in infants as young as four.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Various theories have been put forward. One holds that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/28/heres-why-spiky-shapes-seem-angry-and-round-sounds-are-calming/&quot;&gt;levels of emotional arousal may be key&lt;/a&gt; — that both &lt;em&gt;kiki &lt;/em&gt;and a spiky shape trigger relatively high levels of arousal, compared with &lt;em&gt;bouba&lt;/em&gt; and a blob. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620927967&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, reported in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, provides compelling evidence for this idea. The researchers also take their findings further, arguing that they could have important implications for understanding the early evolution of languages.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40093&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For an initial study, Arash Aryani at Freie Universität Berlin and colleagues presented English-speaking students (at Cornell University, US) with shapes and words taken from previous studies that have investigated the bouba-kiki effect. (For example, &lt;em&gt;maluma&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;takete&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scirp.org/(S(351jmbntvnsjt1aadkposzje))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=870792&quot;&gt;the original 1929 report &lt;/a&gt;of this word/shape effect). In each case, the participants had to use a five-point scale to rate how calming or exciting they considered these words or shapes to be. The results revealed significantly higher arousal ratings for kiki-type than bouba-type words and shapes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the team asked a fresh group of participants to use the same scale to rate 940 computer-generated pseudo-words (which were all spoken in a neutral tone by an actor) for how arousing they sounded. These pseudo-words all sounded like they could be English words, but they had no meaning (think &lt;em&gt;tylo&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sooking&lt;/em&gt;, for example). Separately, the team analysed them, looking for particular acoustic features that earlier work has suggested we use to infer different emotional states. (For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.0990&quot;&gt;variations in the fundamental frequency of even animal sounds lead us to infer different emotions&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly-pulsating sounds are associated with high arousal.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear relationship — those pseudo-words that the researchers expected, based on their acoustic analysis, to trigger more arousal received higher arousal ratings from the participants. The same was true for low arousal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then applied the acoustic model to the specific bouba-like and kiki-like words that they’d used in the first experiment. They found that the model predicted significantly higher arousal values for the kiki-like words than for the bouba-like words. This suggested, then, that the acoustic features of &lt;em&gt;bouba&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;kiki&lt;/em&gt; (and similar pairs) explain the low vs high arousal ratings given by the participants in the first study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, the results suggest that, no matter what the word (or pseudo-word), depending on its acoustic features, it will trigger different perceptions of arousal. “Any wordlike stimulus can potentially convey emotional information solely on the basis of its perceptual acoustic characteristics, making it possible to match it with emotionally similar concepts, eg. shapes,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the results of the second experiment, the researchers then identified groups of “high-arousal”, “medium-arousal”, and “low-arousal” pseudo-words. They asked a fresh batch of participants to match these to a range of spiky and rounded shapes (again taken from previous studies). As the team predicted, spiky shapes were most likely to be matched to high-arousal pseudo-words (followed by medium-arousal and then finally low-arousal examples), while rounded shapes were most likely to be matched to the low arousal group. “These results suggest that the extent to which a word in a bouba-kiki experiment is matched with a rounded shape or spiky shape depends on the level of arousal elicited by its sound,” the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings not only support the emotional arousal theory to explain the bouba-kiki effect but may also shed light on the early stages of language evolution, they add.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finding that humans can reliably identify levels of arousal in the vocal sounds of a range of animals is telling, they think. “An initial form of vocalisation might have been a motor reflection of arousal in the vocal tract. Such vocalisations might gradually have been used to refer to external objects that were associated with similar affective experience.” So a sharp rock could become associated with high-arousal sounds (and note the “sharp” sound of &lt;em&gt;rock&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;bubble&lt;/em&gt;, say.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If our early speech sounds and words were grounded in our emotional, arousal system, this could have made them easier to learn, and so more likely to be retained, the team thinks. And though most words are often held up to be arbitrary, there’s increasing evidence that this is often not the case — our word sound/meaning links go deeper than the onomatopoeia of &lt;em&gt;crack&lt;/em&gt; for instance, or the ideogram of &lt;em&gt;zigzag&lt;/em&gt;, and can, it seems, be grounded in our emotional responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620927967&quot;&gt;Affective Arousal Links Sound to Meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A robot beetle goes the distance on its own thanks to a methanol-fueled micromuscle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists envision that swarms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-sized-bot-first-both-fly-land&quot;&gt;robotic insects could assist search-and-rescue operations&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/19/16&lt;/em&gt;). But tight spaces are out of reach for robots that must be tethered to an energy source. The new bot, described August 19 in &lt;em&gt;Science Robotics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aba0015&quot;&gt;carries its liquid fuel inside its body&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I realized the critical issue was power,” says Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia. His team at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles turned to methanol because in a given mass, it packs over 10 times the energy as tiny batteries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To turn methanol into motion, the researchers coated a nickel-titanium alloy wire with platinum. The alloy contracts like a muscle when heated, and extends once cool. The platinum generates heat by combusting any methanol vapor that comes in contact with it. By varying the exposure to fuel in a periodic pattern, the temperature varies and the micromuscle accordions. That motion causes the bot’s forelegs to rear up. When the legs scooch back again, the body drags forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;This beetle bot may weigh only as much as three grains of rice but to crawl it needs a tiny yet mighty source of fuel. Instead of tethering it to a power source, scientists stowed methanol inside the robot’s body, where it powers an artificial micromuscle. That self-contained fuel could be a crucial advance in creating bots that can swarm into tight spaces during search-and-rescue missions.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excluding fuel, the beetle bot weighs about as much as three grains of rice, on par with live insects. It crawls on flat surfaces while carrying up to 2.6 times its weight. It tackles inclines steeper than the toughest treadmill setting. And it can run for over one hour, Pérez-Arancibia says. With a battery — even a state-of-the-art one — it would run for a few seconds at best, he estimates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s room for improvement: The beetle is slower than comparable robots and can’t be steered. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9165070&quot;&gt;Next-generation prototypes&lt;/a&gt; will use the same artificial muscle principle with a speedier, more maneuverable design and a different fuel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flying robots are his ultimate goal. Specifically? “We want to do butterflies,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Grimaces, scowls and doting gazes of ancient human sculptures indicate that there are universal facial expressions that signal the same emotions across cultures, researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Faces depicted in sculptures crafted between 3,500 and 600 years ago in Mexico and Central America convey five varieties of emotion to Westerners today, say computational neuroscientist Alan Cowen and psychologist Dacher Keltner, both of the University of California, Berkeley. Present-day folks, and likely members of ancient American societies as well, anticipate that each of &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abb1005&quot;&gt;these emotional expressions occurs in particular social situations&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists report August 19 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As participants in the new study predicted just by looking at the faces of sculpted individuals, pain expressions characterized sculptures of people being tortured, expressions combining determination and strain accompanied heavy lifting, angry faces occurred in combat, elated expressions appeared in people being held or embraced and sad faces typified individuals in defeat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That link between ancient and modern groups “provides strong support for universality and genetic origins of these [particular] emotion expressions,” says psychologist Jessica Tracy of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Cowen and Keltner regard their findings as a preliminary glimpse of how people who lived long ago, and who had no exposure to any modern culture, expressed certain emotions with their faces as Westerners now do. Researchers have argued for decades about whether certain facial expressions have evolved to express specific emotions, such as happiness, anger and disgust, regardless of one’s culture. Previous comparisons of facial expressions across different modern societies have been complicated by the fact that people everywhere, including hunter-gatherers, have to some extent encountered Westerners and been influenced by their cultural practices. By looking deep into the past, the new study gets around that problem, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigators first identified 63 ancient American sculptures from museum collections portraying people in eight situations — being held captive, being tortured, carrying a heavy object, embracing someone, holding a baby, preparing to fight, playing a ballgame and playing music. Sculptures came from ancient societies that included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-reveals-oldest-biggest-ancient-maya-structure-found-mexico&quot;&gt;the Olmec and the Maya&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/3/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A total of 325 English-speaking participants, averaging nearly 36 years old, viewed images of each sculpture’s face without being able to see the rest of the sculpture or discern its context. Volunteers, recruited from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mturk.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s online hiring site, rated either the extent to which faces portrayed 30 emotions, such as awe and anger, or the extent to which faces displayed 13 broader emotional states, such as pleasantness and alertness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another 114 participants rated the extent to which someone described in written accounts of each of the eight situations depicted by the sculptures would express the same 30 emotions or 13 emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sculptures’ facial expressions generally aligned with what participants expected to see in each situation. On average, for example, facial expressions of pain and distress clustered among sculpted individuals shown being tortured, in line with what Westerners predicted would occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Torture victim sculpture from Mexico&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090572&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081820_bb_emotions_inline1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090572&quot;&gt;One expression common across cultures may be exemplified by the howl of pain on the sculpted face of this torture victim, researchers say.

&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that facial expressions have evolved to convey a richer variety of emotions than scientists have often assumed, Cowen says. For instance, a well-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paulekman.com/resources/universal-facial-expressions/&quot;&gt;system that categorizes seven basic emotions&lt;/a&gt; communicated by the same facial expressions in all cultures does not include expressions of pain and of the combination of determination and strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Cowen and Keltner deserve credit for taking a novel approach to studying facial expressions, the results won’t quell debate over whether certain expressions communicate the same meaning across cultures, says psychologist Deborah Roberson of the University of Essex in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;English speakers today hold consistent assumptions about how emotional facial expressions should be deployed, as the new study shows, Roberson says. But ancient American cultures likely put distinctive spins on nonverbal emotional communication that researchers today may never be able to recognize, she contends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yale University psychologist Maria Gendron agrees. Even today, emotional meanings of faces may not translate across cultures, she says. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/44/12403&quot;&gt;Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; perceive anger and threat in the same wide-eyed, gasping faces that Westerners view as expressions of fear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People living in small, relatively isolated communities, such as Himba farmers and herders in southern Africa, often rank facial emotions differently than Westerners do if asked to describe on their own what a facial expression shows, Roberson says. In such traditional societies, everybody knows each other well, so there is no need to assume that facial expressions reflect particular emotional states, she argues. “If someone is mean and grouchy most of the time, you are likely to be wary of them even when they’re smiling.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Australia’s dingoes are getting bigger, and it may be because of humans. New research suggests the change is happening only in places where the wild canine’s populations are controlled with poison.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings could illustrate for the first time that, when targeted with pesticides, changes to the physical traits of “pest” species can occur in bigger animals, not just insects and rodents.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists had noticed &lt;a href=&quot;https://bioone.org/journals/Australian-Journal-of-Zoology/volume-60/issue-2/ZO12006/An-assessment-of-the-taxonomic-status-of-wild-canids-in/10.1071/ZO12006.short&quot;&gt;an increase in the size of some dingoes&lt;/a&gt;, but that there hasn’t been much understanding of what was causing it, says Michael Letnic, an ecologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. He wondered if it was the consequence of decades of the dingoes’ status as a livestock pest.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dingoes (&lt;em&gt;Canis lupus dingo&lt;/em&gt;) have long had an uneasy relationship with farmers and ranchers in rural Australia. The predators can attack livestock, usually sheep. Shooting and fencing have been used to control dingo populations and protect livestock. But in the 1960s and 1970s, a new tool was also employed in western and southern Australia: a poison called sodium monofluoroacetate, or 1080. Odorless and tasteless, the powder could be mixed into bits of meat and scattered across the landscape as deadly bait for dingoes to snatch up. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A dose’s effectiveness is dependent on a dingo’s mass, which led Letnic to test the idea that 1080 use might be related to dingoes’ size change. He and Mathew Crowther, an ecologist at the University of Sydney, delved into museum collections of dingo skulls, collected from across three areas that have been exposed to 1080 for about 50 to 60 years, and one region where baiting is banned. The skulls date from 1930 to the present day, so by measuring their length (a proxy for a dingo’s body size), the researchers could compare the sizes of the animals before and after poisoning began. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After examining more than 500 skulls, the team found that in baited regions, female dingoes’ skulls have grown 4.5 millimeters longer, on average, in the era after 1080 was introduced. Male skulls are 3.6 millimeters longer than they were. These changes equate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blaa084/5879439?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;a roughly 6 and 9 percent jump in body mass in males and females, respectively&lt;/a&gt;, or about a one kilogram increase on average, the team reports July 31 in the &lt;em&gt;Biological Journal of the Linnean Society&lt;/em&gt;. In contrast, skulls from dingoes in the unbaited region did not significantly change in length over the same time period.     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dingoes are top predators whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/truths-and-lies-about-dingoes&quot;&gt;appetites send ripple effects through the food web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(SN: 1/13/14)&lt;/em&gt;. Kangaroo numbers increase when dingo populations are controlled, so the combination of extra prey availability and reduced competition may make it easier for dingoes that aren’t killed by the poison to find food and grow. “By reducing the dingo population, [1080 is] changing the environment that dingoes are growing up in,” Letnic says. Bigger dingoes may then, in turn, be more tolerant of the poison’s effects, their body size outpacing a relatively constant dosage over the years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known for a long time that if we spray our fields with pesticides, then the insects that we’re trying to kill change and develop resistance” to the pesticides, Letnic says. “This work suggests that when we use pesticides on big animals, we can produce comparable changes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the study is based on correlations rather than experimental manipulation of dingo populations, so pinning down precisely what’s causing the change is tricky. But the team’s search for possible alternative explanations for the size increase came up short. Climate change can cause size shifts, but animals tend to get smaller as temperatures rise, not bigger. Interbreeding with domesticated dogs might make the dingoes bigger, but the skulls all came from areas of Australia with negligible rates of dog-dingo hybrids. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiyoko Gotanda, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Cambridge not involved with the research, says that while the effects of hunting on animal traits are often investigated, she’s “unaware of studies looking at how using poisoning as a control method for vertebrates might also induce [physical or behavioral] change… I would also be interested to learn if changes to body size occur once you stop using poison control on the predators,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If dingoes are growing in size in response to 1080 exposure, there could be ecological implications down the line. Bigger dingoes can hunt bigger prey, notes Letnic, which could have unknown impacts on Australian ecosystems. And dingoes aren’t the only worry. The poison is also used to control other “pests,” including invasive red foxes, which devour many threatened animals. If the foxes become tolerant of 1080, the conservation consequences could be harsh, Letnic says.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/movie-nikola-tesla-biopic-ethan-hawke-inventor"/>

		<updated>2020-08-19T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;It is a David and Goliath story for the Industrial Age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Young, idealistic Nikola Tesla came to the United States in 1884 hoping that electricity mogul Thomas Edison would work with him on a new system for generating and distributing electricity. Tesla’s alternating current system promised to transmit electricity much greater distances than the reigning direct current setup that Edison had pioneered. But Edison dismissed Tesla’s ideas as impractical, forcing Tesla to strike out on his own.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifcfilms.com/films/tesla&quot;&gt;new biopic &lt;em&gt;Tesla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, directed by Michael Almereyda, follows what came to be known as the War of the Currents between Tesla and Edison. The film premieres August 21, available on demand through a variety of cable and digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tesla (portrayed by Ethan Hawke) is the underdog hero. He lacks Edison’s business acumen and penchant for self-promotion, but is armed with a visionary idea and relentless ambition. To make his electrical system a reality, Tesla struggles against duplicitous business partners and a smear campaign by Edison (Kyle MacLachlan) to cast alternating current as unsafe. In one macabre scene, one of Edison’s employees goes so far as to publicly electrocute a dog with alternating current.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Tesla’s system wins out as the preeminent means of electrical production and distribution worldwide. (Although the film doesn’t explain in detail, AC has an edge over DC electricity because it is easily switched between high and low voltages. That allows high-voltage electricity to travel efficiently across long power lines before getting converted to low voltages for safe in-home use.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Almereyda’s Tesla is a modest man, more concerned with using his inventions for good than earning money or recognition. But &lt;em&gt;Tesla &lt;/em&gt;also explores the less flattering aspects of the inventor’s character. His reclusiveness and overactive mind made it difficult to maintain relationships. One of Tesla’s most loyal associates was Anne Morgan (Eve Hewson), daughter of J.P. Morgan, the Wall Street titan who was a patron of Tesla’s work. Anne Morgan was drawn to Tesla’s intellect and altruism, and seemed to want to marry him. But Tesla was married to his work, and ultimately moved to Colorado without Morgan to pursue mysterious, lightning-powered experiments. Thus began the second act of Tesla’s career, during which he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/strange-electrical-genius&quot;&gt;chased increasingly outlandish ideas&lt;/a&gt; that scared off investors and left him destitute (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/7/56&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morgan occasionally breaks the fourth wall to narrate Tesla’s story, as though she were reflecting on it from a modern perspective, armed with a laptop and projector to display visuals. The film also invokes other unusual storytelling elements, such as playing out alternative scenes to explore what might have been. Some of these what-if scenarios are intriguing, like one where Edison admits he misjudged Tesla and suggests they become an electrical engineering dynamic duo. Some of these scenes are just whacky, such as when Tesla smashes an ice cream cone into Edison’s face during an argument. (“This is pretty surely not how it happened,” Morgan narrates.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such quirks are off-putting at times, but overall, &lt;em&gt;Tesla &lt;/em&gt;is a lot like its namesake: introspective, intriguing and oddly charming.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv&quot;&gt;Sofia Deleniv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This passage, pulled from Isaiah 41.10, is just one example of the Bible’s many references to God’s power to protect. And this protective persona might affect you much more than you think. At least that’s what emerged in 2015, when researchers from Stanford University published a string of studies finding that &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797614563108?casa_token=kI9UANJRFMQAAAAA%3AE1UVVQWf5QHj2jSgvhawv2kDn6w8rhexo14CmTI74rZziCnSeA-CSasanAo4lYHhFm6GvR1MF3Xe&quot;&gt;people prompted to think of God made significantly riskier decisions&lt;/a&gt; — whether or not they were religious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The scientists’ explanation, promptly picked up by the media, was that thinking of God makes risk-taking less intimidating because it primes us to expect divine protection. As of recently, however, this narrative has not stood up to scrutiny. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620922477&quot;&gt;first pre-registered replication of this study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that the effect was probably no more than an exciting false positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40080&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The failure to replicate such a high-profile experiment will probably come as a disappointment. The original publication had certainly generated a global splash, giving rise to headlines like &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/religion-makes-people-take-or-avoid-risks-skydiving-versus-drinking-gambling-sex.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;God is my co-pilot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/social-justice/thank-god-for-risky-behavior&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank God for risky behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;”. &lt;/em&gt;In many ways, the study stated a convincing case. It featured nine experiments, all of which concurred that being reminded of God triggered a significant increase in people’s tendency to take on risk. In these experiments, a mix of religious and non-religious participants from across the US were prompted to think either of God or an unrelated topic, such as astronomy. In most cases, this was achieved by having participants solve scrambled sentences, which either contained religions words (e.g. “spirit” or “divine”) or non-religious words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then indicated how likely they were to engage in a range of risky behaviours related to ethical dilemmas (like taking credit for someone else’s work), safety concerns (driving a car without a seatbelt) or social risk (starting a whole new career in one’s mid-thirties). The effects seemed clear. Those who had been primed to think of God were significantly more likely to consider engaging in risky behaviours, as long as these did not involve an ethical transgression. Moreover, participants in the “God-prime” condition perceived significantly less risk in all of these behaviours, as if thinking of God really had reduced the sense of threat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But some researchers were concerned. Looking at the string of statistical results, many of which had just made it over the threshold of significance, one couldn’t help but wonder — what if this divine protection effect was just a statistical blip? The answer arrived a few weeks ago, when Will Gervais from the University of Kentucky and colleagues repeated two of the original 2015 experiments in exact detail, but with one crucial difference. They recruited a substantially larger sample of over a thousand participants, which was designed to give the researchers a very strong probability of detecting the “God-prime” effect, if it did really exist. Their study revealed no evidence that being primed to think of God had the power to make people choose riskier behaviours. There was no effect even when the authors ran a mini meta-analysis combining their own findings with those of the original publication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, this failed replication has not been met with the media attention that surrounded the original paper. Perhaps that study struck a chord because it resonated with our long-held ideas about the function of religion. Many sociologists and psychologists believe that religion helps individuals deal with stress by offering a padding of divine protection, which makes the chaos and volatility of daily life less frightening. Indeed, the “God comfort hypothesis” has received considerable support from international surveys, which find that &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx,%20https:/doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0021140&quot;&gt;national levels of religion tend to go hand-in-hand with governmental instability and poor material security&lt;/a&gt;. Strife might directly throw previously unbelieving people into the arms of God. This was observed in Christchurch, New Zealand, where researchers spotted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049648&quot;&gt;sudden spike in religiosity&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of its devastating 2011 earthquake. Thus, when researchers discovered that the sense of security associated with God not only gives us perceived shelter from risk, but actually emboldens us to seek it out, their findings might have enjoyed some degree of automatic credibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But experience should have taught us that caution is the better policy. Researchers have failed to replicate a host of high-profile discoveries,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/28/54-study-analysis-says-power-posing-does-affect-peoples-emotions-and-is-worth-researching-further/&quot;&gt;from the controversial effects of “power posing”&lt;/a&gt; on our confidence and stress hormones, to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/16/another-social-psychology-classic-bites-the-dust-meta-analysis-finds-little-evidence-for-the-macbeth-effect&quot;&gt;Macbeth Effect&lt;/a&gt;, which claims that having our moral purity threatened makes us literally want to clean ourselves. As psychological science works to recover from its replication crisis, and scientific editors increasingly realise the importance of publishing negative results, communicators of popular science may need to be careful about overstating the certainty of new and exciting findings. As with the God-priming effect, some discoveries might not be scientific scripture after all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620922477&quot;&gt;Do Religious Primes Increase Risk Taking? Evidence Against “Anticipating Divine Protection” in Two Preregistered Direct Replications of Kupor, Laurin, and Levav (2015)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The fusiform face area, or FFA, is a small region found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inferior&lt;/a&gt; (bottom) surface of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;temporal lobe&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gyrus&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fusiform gyrus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the fusiform face area and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;By the late 1990s, researchers had built up a fair amount of evidence that suggested there are parts of our brain that are especially active when we look at faces. This research led neuroscientists to hypothesize that certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; are specialized to process information about faces, and that these neurons are essential to normal face perception. According to this view, the parts of the brain involved in face perception might be distinct from the parts of the brain involved in perceiving other things like objects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 1997, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9151747/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;researchers published a groundbreaking study&lt;/a&gt; that not only supported the idea of face-specific processing in the brain, but also added some important anatomical detail. The study, by Nancy Kanwisher and colleagues, used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&lt;/a&gt; to identify areas of the brain that were highly active when participants looked at faces. In the process, the researchers found a region about the size of a blueberry on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inferior&lt;/a&gt; (bottom) surface of the temporal lobe that displayed a disproportionate amount of activity when participants viewed faces—but not when they viewed other things like houses, hands, or cars. In most patients, this activity was seen predominantly on the right side of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The data suggested to Kanwisher and her fellow researchers that this region—found in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gyrus&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fusiform gyrus&lt;/a&gt;—was specialized for processing information about faces; they called it the &lt;em&gt;fusiform face area&lt;/em&gt;, or FFA. The hypothesis that the FFA is a face-processing module aligned with previous imaging studies that had also linked face perception to this general area of the brain, as well as with cases of patients who had experienced damage to the FFA and subsequently developed a condition known as &lt;em&gt;prosopagnosia&lt;/em&gt;, which involves an impairment in the ability to recognize faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Further studies also supported the hypothesis of Kanwisher et al. For example, an experiment with monkeys that recorded the activity of neurons in the FFA &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16456083/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;found that 97% of the neurons in the area were active in response to facial imagery&lt;/a&gt;, but not in response to images of things like objects or other body parts. And another study found that delivering short bursts of electrical charge to the FFA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3517886/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;caused disruptions in the perception of faces&lt;/a&gt;. Today—over 20 years after the initial publication by Kanwisher et al. that coined the term &lt;em&gt;fusiform face area&lt;/em&gt;—it’s safe to say there is convincing evidence that the FFA is involved in perceiving faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of debate about the details surrounding the anatomy and function of the FFA. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22481071/&quot;&gt;some argue&lt;/a&gt; that while parts of the FFA may play a role in face perception, the region probably consists of multiple visual areas that should be considered as distinct (both anatomically and functionally) rather than as one structure devoted to face perception. Additionally, some argue that—rather than being localized primarily to the FFA—face recognition involves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345271/&quot;&gt;a network of brain regions that extends beyond just the FFA to include other parts of the occipital and temporal lobes as well&lt;/a&gt;. According to both of these perspectives, attributing such a large role in face perception to the FFA alone may be a bit of an oversimplification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;But probably the loudest critique of the idea that the FFA is a primary face-processing area of the brain is the suggestion that the FFA is not only specialized for the perception of faces, but also for the perception of all objects we have a high level of familiarity and experience with. This idea is sometimes referred to as the &lt;em&gt;expertise hypothesis&lt;/em&gt;, and it suggests that the FFA is activated in response to faces because we are, to some degree, face experts. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10649576/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one study found activity in the FFA to also be increased&lt;/a&gt; in response to objects like cars and birds, and the increase was correlated with the degree of expertise someone had in identifying these objects (birdwatchers and car aficionados displayed greater activity). &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21752997/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Another study found the FFA to be active when chess experts&lt;/a&gt; viewed chess positions on a chessboard, and yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452573/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another found that experienced radiologists had more activity in the FFA&lt;/a&gt; when viewing x-rays than med students did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The expertise hypothesis, however, has also faced its fair share of criticism. The studies supporting the expertise hypothesis have tended to be small, and often the effects seen in those studies have not been very large. Nevertheless, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276714/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a 2019 analysis of the results of 18 studies&lt;/a&gt; found that, even when the methodological concerns stated above are taken into consideration, the evidence strongly favors the expertise hypothesis. Thus, the precise role of the FFA in face perception continues to be debated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Burns EJ, Arnold T, Bukach CM.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Spewing virus-laden droplets may not be the only way animals can spread some viruses through the air. Viruses like influenza might also hitch a ride on dust and other microscopic particles, a study in guinea pigs suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People can transmit respiratory viruses, like the ones that cause flu and COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-breathing-talking-enough-spread-airborne&quot;&gt;just by talking&lt;/a&gt;, coughing and sneezing (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/2/20&lt;/em&gt;). Virus-contaminated surfaces, called fomites, can also cause infection when people touch the surface and then their nose or mouth. Now new research suggests that dust particles kicked up from those contaminated surfaces, called aerosolized fomites, may also spread such respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our work suggests that there is a mode of [virus] transmission that is underappreciated” for influenza, says William Ristenpart, a chemical engineer at the University of California, Davis. “It’s not on [scientists’] radar.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Though the study, published August 18 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, did not include the new coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, the finding could have implications for that virus too, Ristenpart says. Researchers are still figuring out all the ways the coronavirus spreads, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-airborne-aerosol-transmission&quot;&gt;debating how much smaller respiratory droplets&lt;/a&gt; that remain in the air, called aerosols, might contribute to transmission (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/7/20&lt;/em&gt;). Hantavirus, which causes a deadly respiratory disease, can also be transmitted through kicked up dust that is contaminated with rodent droppings. But that virus doesn’t pass from person-to-person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Ristenpart and his colleagues infected guinea pigs with influenza virus. Two days later, the team found infectious influenza viruses in cages as well as on guinea pig fur, ears and paws. Infected guinea pigs don’t cough or sneeze like people do, so the virus may have spread when the rodents groomed, rubbed their noses or moved around the cage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used a paintbrush to coat virus on animals that had already been infected and were immune. Each virus-covered rodent was put in a cage separate from, but attached to, a cage housing an uninfected companion. The setup ensured that the only way to spread the virus from one animal to another was through the air. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the flu-covered immune rodents were not breathing virus into the air, the flu still spread among three of 12 guinea pig pairs. The newly infected animals may have gotten infected from aerosolized fomites in dust kicked up from bedding or fur, the study suggests.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Airborne dust  &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some common items people use could be potential vehicles to spread respiratory viruses via aerosolized fomites, or dust kicked up from contaminated surfaces. The graph shows the number of particles emitted per second over time when rubbing together pieces of toilet paper (blue), paper towel (red) and lab wipes (black) to produce dust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Dust particles emitted from household items over time&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090543&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081820_EG_guinea-dust_inline_1_desktop.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090543&quot;&gt;S. Asadi &lt;em&gt;et al/Nat. Comm&lt;/em&gt;. 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090542&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081820_EG_guinea-dust_inline_1_mobile.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090542&quot;&gt;S. Asadi &lt;em&gt;et al/Nat. Comm&lt;/em&gt;. 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that all dust is infectious,” Ristenpart says, but “dust liberated from a virus-laden surface” may be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In human settings, that dust might come from used tissues, sheets or blankets. Or perhaps from a doctor’s personal protective equipment or a cloth mask. In a preliminary study that has not yet been reviewed by other researchers, Ristenpart and his team found that homemade cotton masks can shed minuscule particles when people breathe, making them a potential source for aerosolized fomites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what the results might mean for respiratory virus transmission among humans. While it is possible that aerosolized fomites might spread influenza, people would still need to breathe the virus in to get infected, says Julian Tang, a virologist and fluid dynamicist at the University of Leicester in England who was not involved in the work. Dust from guinea pig bedding may be aerosolized much more easily than from a medical professional’s personal protective equipment or bed sheets. So compared with airborne influenza virus — or SARS-CoV-2 — in exhaled breath, “I’m really not convinced that in humans, this aerosolized fomite route will play any [major] role,” Tang says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music and humans go back a very long way. The earliest accepted instruments, made from bones, appear on the European scene about 40,000 years ago. But for perhaps at least a million years before that, our ancestors had the throat architecture that in theory would have allowed them to sing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All kinds of ideas have been put forward for why and how music came to matter so much to us. But what’s abundantly clear is that it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter; there isn’t a society out there that doesn’t make and listen to music. And new research is now revealing all manner of psychological and neurological effects…&lt;span id=&quot;more-40074&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But what about people who don’t like music?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is a human universal, but it’s true — not everyone enjoys music. In fact, as a 2014 paper published in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; revealed, some perfectly healthy people can perceive music just like anybody else, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00133-X?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S096098221400133X?showall=true&quot;&gt;their reward-related neural circuits don’t respond to it&lt;/a&gt;. (These circuits do still respond to food or money, for example, so it’s not that they’re generally defective).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/31/2/118/62587/Individual-Differences-in-Music-Reward-Experiences&quot;&gt;estimated 3-5% of people&lt;/a&gt; experience “musical anhedonia”, and get no pleasure from music. (To find out where you sit on the music reward spectrum, you could fill in the team’s questionnaire, available &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainvitge.org/z_oldsite/bmrq.php&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Last year, a team that included some of the same researchers published a follow-up study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/25/5018&quot;&gt;found a neurobiological basis for their earlier observations&lt;/a&gt;: differences in the white matter “wiring” that connects the auditory cortex and the ventral striatum, a key part of the reward system. What causes these differences is not yet clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For the rest of us, what is it about a piece of music that gives us pleasure?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, a team led by Vincent Cheung at the Max-Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31258-8?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982219312588?showall=true&quot;&gt;analysis of responses to 745 US Billboard pop songs&lt;/a&gt;. They found that expectancy is key. When listeners were pretty certain about which chord to expect next (based on what had come before), they found it pleasurable to be surprised. When they weren’t sure what to expect, though, more predictable subsequent chords were pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular songs strike a good balance between both subverting expectation and reassuring listeners, the team concluded. “It is fascinating that humans can derive pleasure from a piece of music just by how sounds are ordered over time,” Cheung commented. It is also important for understanding how music influences our emotional state…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do we like listening to sad music?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point to stress is that we don’t all necessarily like it. In 2016, a team led by Tuomas Eerola at the University of Durham &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157444&quot;&gt;reported on the emotional experiences connected with sad music&lt;/a&gt; of 2,436 people in the UK and Finland. The majority said they enjoyed sad music, and that this pleasure boosted their mood. “However, there are people who absolutely hate sad-sounding music and avoid listening to it,” notes Eerola. The study revealed that for these people, sad music was associated with painful personal experiences, such as loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the reports of mood-&lt;em&gt;boosting&lt;/em&gt; effects from the majority is important. In 2015, a paper titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615583295&quot;&gt;Sad as a Matter of Choice?&lt;/a&gt;” reported that people with depression were more likely to listen to sad songs — which the team controversially took to imply that they were maintaining or even worsening their own low mood. Last year, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-10869-001&quot;&gt;a study published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that depressed people prefer sad music because it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/24/why-do-people-with-depression-like-listening-to-sad-music/&quot;&gt;calming and even uplifting&lt;/a&gt;. As some participants in another recent study commented, when you’re feeling low, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/15/why-do-people-like-listening-to-sad-music-when-theyre-feeling-down/&quot;&gt;sad music can seem like a supportive friend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extreme emotions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pieces of music have dramatic effects on us. “Peak emotional states” involve powerful physical responses, such as tears, or feeling “the chills”, and often extreme sadness or joy. They can be triggered by something inherently deeply meaningful — such as childbirth — but also by a beautiful view, or piece of music. A 2017 study published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/02/psychologists-have-studied-whats-happening-when-music-gives-us-chills-or-makes-us-cry/&quot;&gt;explored these reactions&lt;/a&gt;, and found that song-induced tears were associated with subsequent calming — they seem, then, to have a cathartic, relieving function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people, though, are more prone than others to feeling goosebumps or a shiver down the spine in response to a piece of music. And as a paper recently published in &lt;em&gt;Social Cognitive and Effective Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; has revealed, such people have &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/6/884/2223400&quot;&gt;stronger connectivity between auditory processing and social and emotional processing areas&lt;/a&gt; of the brain. These same connectivity differences have also been linked to greater empathy. As the researchers write in their paper: “Perhaps one of the reasons why music is a cross-culturally indispensable artifact is that it appeals directly through an auditory channel to emotional and social processing centers of the human brain.” Only, it does this more for some of us than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Connecting brains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One proposed adaptive function for music is that it unites individuals. With music, we can march together, dance together, and express emotions as one. And there’s now growing evidence that this unity can occur right down at the neural level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009, Ulman Lindenberger at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and colleagues reported that when two guitarists play the same piece of music together, their brainwaves synchronise. Big deal, you might think: they’re processing and playing identical notes, so why shouldn’t there be similarities in their brain activity? However, in 2012, the team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00312/full&quot;&gt;reported a follow-up&lt;/a&gt; involving duets with &lt;em&gt;different &lt;/em&gt;guitar parts. When these pairs had to actively coordinate their playing, there was a synchronisation in activity in some regions &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; the two. This, the team concluded, was evidence of “inter-brain networks”. “When people coordinate actions with one another, small networks within the brain and, remarkably, between the brains are formed,” noted Johanna Sänger, lead author of this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, more evidence of inter-brain synchronisation during musical experiences has emerged. It’s known that when audience members are enjoying a piece of live music, their brainwaves tend to synchronise. And, earlier this year, a team led by Yingying Hou at East China Normal University revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/23/musicians-and-their-audiences-show-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity/&quot;&gt;when a musician is playing a piece, and the audience is enjoying it, a synchronisation in brain activity develops.&lt;/a&gt; The team were even able to use the strength of this “inter-brain coherence” to predict how much the audience reported enjoying a piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use the beat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are unique as a species in being able to perceive beat. And there’s all kinds of evidence that the tempo of a piece of music affects our behaviour. A classic study, published back in 1986, found that diners in a Dallas restaurant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2489234?seq=1&quot;&gt;ate significantly faster&lt;/a&gt; when faster tempo (more beats per minute) music was played, compared with slow tempo music. These findings went on to influence the choice of soundtracks in restaurants the world over. But there’s also recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00074/full&quot;&gt;evidence that listening to high-tempo music while exercising can increase heart rate&lt;/a&gt; more than slow-tempo music and also make the exercise feel less difficult. “This means that the exercise seemed like less effort but it was more beneficial in terms of enhancing physical fitness,” commented researcher Luca P. Ardigò of the University of Verona in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Background effects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who likes to have background music playing while you work, there are a couple of studies worth bearing in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening even to music that you enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.1731&quot;&gt;can interfere with working memory&lt;/a&gt;, which could impair mental arithmetic, a study published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has found. And though it has been suggested that music can encourage creativity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3532&quot;&gt;in fact it “significantly impairs” it&lt;/a&gt;, according to a 2019 paper published in the same journal. The researchers, from the UK and Sweden, gave participants verbal insight problems, which are meant to tap into creativity. (For example, they were given the words “dress”, “dial”, and “flower”, and asked to identify a single word that could be combined with each — “sun”). Background music with foreign lyrics, instrumental music without lyrics and music with familiar lyrics &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;made the participants worse at this. Again, the researchers think that this is because music disrupts working memory; in this case, verbal working memory. “To conclude, the findings here challenge the popular view that music enhances creativity, and instead demonstrate that music, regardless of the presence of semantic content, consistently disrupts creative performance in insight problem solving,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the negative impact of familiar music was observed even when a participant said it boosted their mood, reported liking the song, or said that they typically studied with background music playing. So if you do typically work with music, and think it helps, surely it’s worth at least trying to go without.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-guinea-plant-species-island-biodiversity"/>

		<updated>2020-08-18T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;To find the island with the most known plant species in the world, head to New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only is New Guinea home to feathered marvels like birds of paradise and cassowaries, the island is also brimming with foliage. Now the first verified count of the flora growing there reveals that New Guinea hosts more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2549-5&quot;&gt;13,600 vascular plant species&lt;/a&gt; — plants like trees and shrubs that have specialized tissue to transport nutrients.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That new inventory shows that New Guinea, which includes Papua New Guinea and Indonesian New Guinea, has the highest known plant diversity of any island on Earth, researchers report August 5 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The survey documented 19 percent more plant species than have been recorded in Madagascar and 22 percent more than Borneo — regions that also rank among the most biodiverse on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new accounting could help &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/connecting-our-dwindling-natural-habitats-could-help-preserve-plant-diversity&quot;&gt;experts preserve&lt;/a&gt; the region’s stunning biodiversity (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/26/19&lt;/em&gt;), the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;From herbs that produce some of the world’s largest bananas to orchids with appendages that look like spiders, New Guinea is filled with astounding examples of botanical specimens. “This region is really just amazing,” says Rodrigo Cámara-Leret, a botanist at the University of Zurich. “Knowing what [plant life] exists is the first step to value what people are surrounded by.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cámara-Leret and 98 other researchers inspected and identified nearly 705,000 plant specimens from New Guinea, the world’s largest tropical island. Overall, the team identified 13,634 species, more than two-thirds of which are endemic, found only on the island. Most of the identified plants were trees, which made up 29 percent of species, closely followed by herbs and plants known as epiphytes that grow on other plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flora forms&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of the plants that experts identified on New Guinea were trees, herbs or plants called epiphytes that grow on other plants, which together account for 77 percent of the species. Here, all of the plant species are separated into one of seven life-forms: trees, herbs, epiphytes, shrubs, climbers, palms and tree ferns. Each box in the grids below the illustrations represents 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Classification of plants in New Guinea by life-form&lt;/h6&gt;

Cámara-Leret &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;New Guinea plant classification chart&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090481&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081420_eg_new-guinea-flora-scivis_inline_mobile_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090481&quot;&gt;R. Cámara-Leret &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there’s still more flora to uncover. The team estimates that over the next 50 years, botanists will add between 3,000 to 4,000 species to the list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s impressive to think that there’s still so many species to discover on the diverse island, Cámara-Leret says. “Every time a botanist goes out there, new species are popping up.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-rock-comet-centaur-astronomy"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090507</id>
		<updated>2020-08-18T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Like the mythical half-human, half-horse creatures, centaurs in the solar system are hybrids between asteroids and comets. Now, astronomers have caught one morphing from one type of space rock to the other, potentially giving scientists an unprecedented chance to watch a comet form in real time in the decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have an opportunity here to see the birth of a comet as it starts to become active,” says planetary scientist Kat Volk of the University of Arizona in Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The object, called P/2019 LD2, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/1244/update-astronomers-recategorize-asteroid-like-comet-detected-by-atlas-telescope/&quot;&gt;discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Hawaii in May&lt;/a&gt;. Its orbit suggests that it’s a centaur, a class of rocky and icy objects with unstable orbits. Because of that mixed composition and potential to move around the solar system, astronomers have long suspected that centaurs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astronomy-183&quot;&gt;a missing link between&lt;/a&gt; small icy bodies in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune and comets that regularly visit the inner solar system (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/19/94&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These “short-period” comets, which are thought to originate from icy objects in the Kuiper Belt, orbit the sun once a decade or so, and make repeat appearances in Earth’s skies. (Long-period comets, like Halley’s Comet, which visits the inner solar system once a century, probably originate even farther from the sun, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oort-cloud-tosses-astronomers-cometary-curveball&quot;&gt;Oort cloud&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/25/13&lt;/em&gt;).)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;All previously found short-period &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rosetta-spacecraft-confabs-comet&quot;&gt;comets&lt;/a&gt; were spotted only after they had transitioned into comets (&lt;em&gt;SN:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;8/6/14&lt;/em&gt;). But LD2 just came in from the Kuiper Belt recently and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02943&quot;&gt;will become a comet in as little as 43 years&lt;/a&gt;, Volk and colleagues report August 10 at arXiv.org.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s weird to think that this object should be becoming a comet when I’m retiring,” Volk says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2019, she and colleagues showed that there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab3fb3&quot;&gt;a region of space just beyond Jupiter that they call the “Gateway”.&lt;/a&gt;  In this area, small planetary objects hang out while warming up and transitioning from outer solar system ice balls to inner solar system comets with their long tails. It’s like a comet incubator, says planetary scientist Gal Sarid of the SETI Institute, who is based in Rockville, Md.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After hearing about LD2, Volk, Sarid and their colleagues simulated thousands of possible trajectories to see where the object had been and where it is going. LD2’s orbit probably took it near Saturn around 1850, and it entered its current orbit past Jupiter after a close encounter with the gas giant in 2017, the team found. The object will leave its present orbit and move in toward the sun in 2063, where heat from the sun will probably sublimate LD2’s volatile elements, giving it a bright cometary tail, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This will be the first ever comet that we know its history, because we’ve seen it before being a comet,” Sarid says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that LD2 is fairly new to the inner reaches of the solar system suggests that it’s made of relatively pristine material that has been in the back of the solar system’s freezer for billions of years, unaltered by heat from the sun. That would make it a time capsule of the early solar system. Studying its composition could help planetary scientists learn what the first planets were made of.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The orbital analysis looks “very reasonable,” says Henry Hsieh, a planetary astronomer with the Planetary Science Institute who is based in Honolulu and was not involved in the study. But studying just one transition object is not enough to open the solar system time capsule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we really need to do is study many of these,” he says. “Study this one first, and then study more of them, and figure out whether this object is an outlier or whether we see a consistent picture.” Future sky surveys, like the ones planned using the future &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin&quot;&gt;Vera Rubin Observatory&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/10/20&lt;/em&gt;), should discover more balls of ice shifting into comets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sarid and colleagues think LD2 could be a good target for a spacecraft to visit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/solar-system/two-centaur-missions-proposed-to-nasas-discovery-program/&quot;&gt;NASA has considered sending spacecraft to centaurs&lt;/a&gt;, although no missions have been selected for development yet. But considering that LD2 will become a comet in just a few decades, scientists don’t have much time to plan, build and launch a mission to visit it. “The windows are closing,” Sarid says. “We really need to be doing this now.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/death-valley-hottest-recorded-temperature-earth"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090526</id>
		<updated>2020-08-17T20:32:35+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Amid a sweltering heat wave across the western United States, a remote spot in Death Valley, Calif., may have just earned the title of hottest place on Earth in nearly a century.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On August 16, the Death Valley spot — appropriately named Furnace Creek, with a population of 24 — logged a temperature of 130° Fahrenheit (54.4° Celsius). If verified by the World Meteorological Organization, or WMO, that temperature will be the hottest recorded since 1931, and the third hottest since record keeping began.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furnace Creek also holds the record for hottest recorded temperature on Earth, logged in 1913 at 134° F (56.7° C). In second place is Kebili, Tunisia, with a logged temperature of 55.0° C (131° F) on July 7, 1931.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The  verification process for such &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-new-high-temperature-heat-record-arctic-siberia-context&quot;&gt;global records of weather extremes&lt;/a&gt;, which are archived at WMO, may take months, says archive chief Randall Cerveny, a meteorologist at Arizona State University in Tempe (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/1/20&lt;/em&gt;). Substantiating a record involves an international committee of atmospheric scientists poring over the original observations, the equipment used to make it and the calibration practices. But “based on available evidence, we are preliminarily accepting the observation,” Cerveny says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some scientists have contested the 1913 observation. In 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/an-investigation-of-death-valleys-134f-world-temperature-record.html&quot;&gt;an analysis posted online at Weather Underground&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the logged temperature was “essentially not possible” based on meteorological conditions, including that there was no evidence of a particularly intense heat wave from any other stations in the area at the time. For now, though, the record stands, because “no credible substantial evidence” supporting this claim has been submitted to WMO, Cerveny says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is precedent for previous records being dismissed once disproven. In 2012, WMO determined that what was then thought to be the hottest recorded temperature, a 1912 observation of 57.8° C (136° F) in Libya, was not valid. That was supported by the discovery in 2010 of the original, mislogged observation sheet bearing five separate errors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Never mind that they’re not viruses. Catching the trend of cocktails called quarantinis and registered racehorse names like Wearamask, two fungal species now have pandemic-inspired monikers. In a nod to the new normal of science, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fly-called-iyaiyai&quot;&gt;names grew out of the frustrations&lt;/a&gt; of trying to keep research alive in an upside-down world (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/23/01&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first case, tiny, fungal leopard spots on saw palmetto leaves turned out to be new to science. Despite looks, they belong to the same family (Xylariaceae) as the black stubs that rise from the ground called dead man’s fingers&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The leopard spots are not just a new species but represent a whole new genus, mycologist Pedro Crous and colleagues announced in the July 2020 &lt;em&gt;Persoonia&lt;/em&gt;. As the pandemic raced across Europe, Crous — working mostly from home instead of in his lab at Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute in Utrecht, the Netherlands — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nhn/pimj/2020/00000044/00000001/art00011&quot;&gt;named the genus “&lt;em&gt;Diabolocovidia,&lt;/em&gt;“ or “devilish COVID.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finding the new species wasn’t that hard, says forest pathologist Jason Smith. He’d had some spotty leaves lying around his lab at the University of Florida in Gainesville when another coauthor visited in search of novelties. “This speaks to something a little broader,” Smith says. Even everyday places hold new fungal species because, unlike birds and mammals, most fungi are unnamed.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the second case, Purdue University biologist Danny Haelewaters was supposed to be on six-nation field trip from Panama to eastern Russia.  Instead, he was grounded in West Lafayette, Ind., socially distant from his coauthor André De Kesel, a mycologist at Belgium’s Miese Botanic Garden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many unknowns don’t get the love they deserve because they’re parasites, Haelewaters laments. Yet “parasites are so incredibly diverse” and influence a host species so much they can essentially “run ecosystems,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hopes of raising interest in these overlooked wonders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mycokeys.pensoft.net/article/53421/&quot;&gt;he chose the epithet &lt;em&gt;quarantenae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for a new species of microscopic &lt;em&gt;Laboulbenia&lt;/em&gt; fungus described July 30 in &lt;em&gt;MycoKeys&lt;/em&gt;. Found twice so far in the botanic garden on a kind of ground beetle, the &lt;em&gt;L. quarantenae&lt;/em&gt; fungi look like tiny, warped bananas with antlers. The new species reproduces only via sex, which is weirdly simple for a fungal lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to leading a happy and fulfilled life, many of us focus on long-term goals: what job we want, whether or not we want children, or how to reach a certain level of skill at a particular hobby or interest. There’s a reason so much research looks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/&quot;&gt;how to achieve&lt;/a&gt; the things you value in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, we often (try to) eschew short-term pleasures, deeming them a distraction from loftier goals. But according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220941998&quot;&gt;a study in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the pursuit of those more immediate pleasures could be just as important for our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40066&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The ability to engage in short term pleasures might not be the same for everybody, reasoned the researchers, Katharina Bernecker from the University of Zurich and Daniela Becker from Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien. In other words, some people may be more liable to fail at achieving short-term pleasurable goals because they’re too focused on long-term ones. So in the first study, the team developed a self-report scale to assess individual differences in this ability to pursue “hedonic” goals. Questions measured hedonic success, or how well people manage to pursue short term pleasures (e.g. “in my spare time, I can relax well”), and intrusive thoughts about long term goals whilst engaging in short term pleasures (e.g. “I cannot stop myself from thinking about things I still need to do”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next pair of studies, the team used the scale to investigate whether people with high or low hedonic capacity experience greater wellbeing. In the first, participants answered questions from the World Health Organization wellbeing scale, which measures cognitive and emotional wellbeing, while in the second, participants completed the Satisfaction With Life scale, rating themselves on items like “in most ways my life is close to my ideal”. Hedonic capacity and self-control were assessed in both, as were physical symptoms (e.g. dizziness and faintness), including those of depression and anxiety (e.g. “nervousness or shakiness inside”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ hedonic capacity was significantly and positively related to both general wellbeing and life satisfaction: people with a greater capacity to pursue short-term pleasures were also happier in their lives. Self-control (which is needed to achieve long-term goals) was also positively associated with wellbeing, but the effect of hedonic capacity was greater. Greater hedonic capacity was also related to fewer physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a third study, hedonic capacity was measured before participants took place in a ten minute relaxation session, during which they stated how many intrusive thoughts they experienced. Before and after this session, participants rated how relaxed, tense, or alert they felt. As expected, those with higher levels of hedonic capacity experienced fewer intrusive thoughts during the relaxation phase; in addition, people who experienced more intrusive thoughts didn’t find the session as relaxing as those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the findings in a real life setting, a fourth study recruited participants in specific contexts — e.g. a cafe, park or in a yoga class. Participants filled in a survey assessing their hedonic capacity and trait self-control, and indicated how much they were enjoying themselves in the moment and their reasons for being there. Companions of the participants also filled in a questionnaire judging the participants’ pleasure in the moment. Again, those with high hedonic capacity reported having a more positive experience and were also judged by others as having a better experience. A further study confirmed these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while a focus on long-term goals and self-control may increase wellbeing, it seems as if short-term pleasures are also a key factor — though intrusive thoughts can hamper this process, as results from the third study suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, self-control is important to some degree — giving in to every whim you experience probably isn’t going to equal a particularly healthy existence, as the team notes: a balance between the two is likely to result in higher levels of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the sort of person who finds it hard to enjoy short-term pleasures and are more likely to experience intrusive thoughts, this balance might be harder to come by than you might hope. But giving yourself permission to eat, drink and be merry could do more for your wellbeing than you might have expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220941998&quot;&gt;Beyond Self-Control: Mechanisms of Hedonic Goal Pursuit and Its Relevance for Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;How do you reassure and prepare for college during this time of crisis?  I have been treating high school and college students for over 30 years and this is a season like no other. Previously, parents were often ambivalent; melancholy about their children growing up and moving away but happy for the privilege of college education. They wonder, how will my child do on their own? Teenagers are often excited, but anxious about social adjustment and new academic demands. Now, in this time of pandemic, financial crisis, and urgency about racial justice, all those typical emotions are overshadowed by a deep uncertainty about the future. Parents are emotionally exhausted and trying to cope with their own fears; this makes the college goodbye talk much more complicated. There is no clear path for the first year or even the first few months of college. Will there be on-campus, in-person classes, distance learning or a hybrid? Many students will not even be leaving in the fall, due to health or financial concerns, or universities’ new schedules with staggered start times. Or will parents say goodbye to their child, only to have colleges close a few months later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students will need more support this year. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, already extremely prevalent among teenagers, have risen significantly during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, the rate of major depressive disorder in teens was 13% overall. A recent sample of college-age people revealed that now over 40% were experiencing depression or anxiety. We need to be concerned about all our teenagers, especially those who were suffering from a psychological disorder before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how to proceed?  Here are some things it’s important for parents to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, provide validation and positive framing. Parents can confirm their children’s feelings that this is a challenging time but still frame the situation positively. The message to a child should be, “We believe that you are ready. Yes, the situation is uncertain. There may well be disappointments or sudden changes and we will all need to be flexible, but we have confidence in you and will still be here for you.” It’s important for parents to approach the situation with an openness and a mindset toward growth. Parents should help teenagers not to fear failure as it is can be part of the ongoing educational process. This type of framing can and increase confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents should also emphasize distress tolerance. Many parents, in the hopes of protecting children from pain, do not help them develop distress tolerance and rush to reassure them or solve their problems. Teenagers are often aware of their strengths and weaknesses, but during a stressful time like this one, they may overlook the coping skills that served them well in the past. Parents should remind their children that negative emotions do not need to be avoided or feared; that they experienced sadness or fear in their lives before and may well again, but they cope and grow. If teens do not avoid negative emotions, they will experience them and see that feelings are temporary. Similarly, parents need to accept that you’re their children will have some bad days but parent do not need to “fix” the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents must also clarify that the college experience fosters the joy of engagement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I see engagement—with a professor, other students, a course of study or an extracurricular activity—as key to a positive college experience. Parents can help children her appreciate that college, even though it may be different from what they imagined, can be an exciting time to explore interests. Engagement is not strictly academic. For LGBTQI teens, college may offer greater acceptance and opportunity. Minority and first generation students, as well as those with learning differences, can find student groups and programs that may help address their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents should identify the ways to obtain psychological help.  There are counseling centers on most campuses and psychotherapy is viewed by most people as not only acceptable but common and normal. Don’t let shame get in the way. Deans and chaplains can provide guidance and also facilitate referrals and many centers offer online scheduling. Parents with children who have  been treated for a psychological problem should plan ahead for ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, parents should use their expertise as parents to identify additional specific areas of concern. Parents know their own children&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;better than anyone else and after years of living together, they can probably enumerate what types of issues worry them, whether social anxiety, academic limitations, sex, body image, substance use and many other issues. Important for parents to let this information guide their conversations. Their teenagers will feel validated and supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/student-leaving-school-after-classes_1314101.htm&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633749722/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-the-healthcare-system-is-failing-people-with-eating-disorders/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/coping-with-covid-deaths-and-what-cinema-tells-us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coping with COVID deaths and what cinema tells us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/cyntoia-brown-and-the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-in-the-legal-system/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hubble-lunar-eclipse-earth-alien-perspective-exoplanet"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;To practice searching for extraterrestrial life, researchers have run a dress rehearsal with the one world they know to be habitable: Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Earth was between the sun and moon for a lunar eclipse in January 2019, the Hubble Space Telescope observed how chemicals in Earth’s atmosphere blocked certain wavelengths of sunlight from reaching the moon. That observing setup mimicked the way astronomers plan to probe the atmospheres of Earthlike exoplanets as they pass in front of their stars, filtering out some starlight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We basically pretend we’re alien observers looking at our planet,” says Giada Arney, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using Hubble, the researchers focused on spotting the effects of atmospheric ozone. Because ozone is both a chemical by-product of oxygen produced in photosynthesis and a shield that protects life from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays, astronomers think atmospheric ozone could be a key indicator that a distant world is habitable. During the lunar eclipse, Hubble examined sunlight that had passed through Earth’s atmosphere and reflected off of the moon for signatures of ozone.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“It’s safer for Hubble to observe sunlight reflected off the moon” than to look directly at the backlit Earth, explains Allison Youngblood, an astronomer at the University of Colorado Boulder. The telescope’s instruments are so sensitive and Earth is so bright that “even the nightside would fry Hubble’s detectors.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those observations revealed &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aba0b4&quot;&gt;prominent dips in particular wavelengths of ultraviolet sunlight&lt;/a&gt; that had been absorbed by the ozone, Youngblood, Arney and colleagues report online August 6 in the &lt;em&gt;Astronomical Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data help confirm that chemicals in the Earth’s atmosphere filter light as expected, based on researchers’ understanding of atmospheric chemistry. That finding gives astronomers more confidence that they will be able to recognize potentially habitable exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The University of Münster in Germany shows with a good example how to act on evidence of data manipulation. Neuroscientist Andreas Püschel has been found guilty of research misconduct. It was once again about a paper authored by his former PhD student and now Luxembourg stem cell researcher, Jens Schwamborn.</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We really struggle to wrap our heads around the idea of exponential growth&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200812-exponential-growth-bias-the-numerical-error-behind-covid-19&quot;&gt;writes David Robson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, we tend to rely on our intuitions and think of growth as linear even when it is not — which could help to explain why many people underestimated the dangers of coronavirus spreading. Researchers say that politicians and the media should be doing more to try and highlight the exponential nature of transmission in an attempt to correct this mathematical bias.&lt;span id=&quot;more-40058&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a lot of the country, this week has been unpleasantly hot. &lt;/strong&gt;And aside from the physical risks, heatwaves can have a variety of effects on our mental health, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/heatwaves-dont-just-give-you-sunburn-they-can-harm-your-mental-health-too-121203&quot;&gt;writes Harriet Ingle&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To combat global problems like climate change, we need to alter our behaviour in ways that might come at a personal cost, even though they benefit the wider community&lt;/strong&gt;. So how do you encourage people to adopt these prosocial attitudes? Making people feel guilty is not the answer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/you-want-people-to-do-the-right-thing-save-them-the-guilt-trip&quot;&gt;explains Claudia R Schnieder&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;. Her research has found that appealing to positive emotions, such as pride in doing the right thing, is more effective at encouraging pro-environmental and prosocial behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists studying animals have traditionally examined how the brain responds to sensory information, or how patterns of brain activity directly relate to an animal’s behaviour. &lt;/strong&gt;But now they’re beginning to look at something altogether more complex: the way in which neuronal activity is related to an animal’s internal state, such as its emotions or drives. At &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02337-x&quot;&gt;Alison Abbott has written a fascinating feature&lt;/a&gt; on the challenges of probing an animal’s frame of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A systematic review has found that, for a small number of people, mindfulness and meditation can have unwanted effects like a worsening of anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2251840-mindfulness-and-meditation-can-worsen-depression-and-anxiety/&quot;&gt;reports Clare Wilson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;. Other researchers say that the study shouldn’t put people off doing meditation, but suggest they do it in a safe context such as guided meditation sessions. For more on mindfulness, it’s worth &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/19/episode-15-is-mindfulness-a-panacea-or-overhyped-and-potentially-problematic/&quot;&gt;checking out our podcast&lt;/a&gt; from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grey reef sharks form surprisingly strong social ties&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902157235/everyone-needs-a-buddy-even-sharks&quot;&gt;report Christopher Intagliata&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers found that the sharks form groups of up to 20 individuals, who they hang out with for years. Being part of a social group gives the sharks certain advantages, such as learning from others where to hunt for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, I missed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/the-correlation-causation-taboo&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; last month from Neuroskeptic (whose posts are always worth reading). &lt;/strong&gt;We all know that correlation does not equal causation — but a paper argues that considering causal inference “taboo” simply results in psychologists making these claims in a more subtle or implicit way. The researchers examined influential studies based on observational data and, as Neuroskeptic puts it, “find evidence of unstated causal claims and assumptions, swept under a correlational rug.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricanes-names-heat-waves-climate-health"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Hurricane Maria and Heat Wave Henrietta?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, meteorologists have named hurricanes and ranked them according to severity. Naming and categorizing heat waves too could increase public awareness of the extreme weather events and their dangers, contends a newly formed group that includes public health and climate experts. Developing such a system is one of the first priorities of the international coalition, called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onebillionresilient.org/post/extreme-heat-resilience-alliance-reducing-extreme-heat-risk-for-vulnerable-people&quot;&gt;Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hurricanes get attention because they cause obvious physical damage, says Jennifer Marlon, a climate scientist at Yale University who is not involved in the alliance. Heat waves, however, have less visible effects, since the primary damage is to human health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future&quot;&gt;Heat waves&lt;/a&gt; kill more people in the United States than any other weather-related disaster (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/3/18&lt;/em&gt;). Data from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/&quot;&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; show that from 1986 to 2019, there were 4,257 deaths as a result of heat. By comparison, there were fewer deaths by floods (2,907), tornadoes (2,203) or hurricanes (1,405) over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;What’s more, climate change is amplifying the dangers of heat waves by increasing the likelihood of high temperature events worldwide. Heat waves linked to climate change include the powerful event that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-france-june-heat-wave-climate-change&quot;&gt;scorched Europe during June 2019&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/2/19&lt;/em&gt;) and sweltering heat in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-siberia-heat-wave-more-likely-global-warming-arctic&quot;&gt;Siberia during the first half of 2020&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/15/20)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some populations are particularly vulnerable to health problems as a result of high heat, including people over 65 and those with chronic medical conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes. Historical racial discrimination also places minority communities at disproportionately higher risk, says Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital and a member of the new alliance. Due to housing policies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm&quot;&gt;communities of color are more likely to live in urban areas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urban-heat&quot;&gt;heat islands&lt;/a&gt; which lack the green spaces that help cool down neighborhoods (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/27/09&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090349&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/080720_ja_heatwave_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090349&quot;&gt;Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital, says giving heat waves names and severity rankings may help save lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090349&quot;&gt;John Wilcox for Coverage, a BCBS of MA news service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the naming and ranking process will involve defining exactly what a heat wave is. No single definition currently exists. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-ww&quot;&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; issues an excessive heat warning when the maximum heat index — which reflects how hot it feels by taking humidity into account — is forecasted to exceed about 41° Celsius (105° Fahrenheit) for at least two days and nighttime air temperatures stay above roughly 24° C (75° F). The World Meteorological Organization and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/heatwaves-health-guidance/en/&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; more broadly describe heat waves as periods of excessively hot weather that cause health problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without a universally accepted definition of a heat wave, “we don’t have a common understanding of the threat we face,” Bernstein says. He has been studying the health effects of global environmental changes for nearly 20 years and is interim director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Defined categories for heat waves could help local officials better prepare to address potential health problems in the face of rising temperatures. And naming and categorizing heat waves could increase public awareness of the health risks posed by these silent killers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Naming [heat waves] will make something invisible more visible,” says climate communicator Susan Joy Hassol of Climate Communication, a project of the Aspen Global Change Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Colorado that’s not part of the new alliance. “It also makes it more real and concrete, rather than abstract.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alliance is in ongoing conversations with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the World Meteorological Organization and other institutions to develop a standard naming and ranking practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People know when a hurricane’s coming,” Hassol says. “It’s been named and it’s been categorized, and they’re taking steps to prepare. And that’s what we need people to do with heat waves.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;For over a thousand years, the various prayers of the Catholic Holy Mass remained largely unaltered. Starting in the 1960s, though, the Catholic Church began implementing changes to make the Mass more modern. One such change occurred on November 27, 2011, when the church attempted to unify the world’s English-speaking Catholics by having them all use the same wording. The changes were slight; for instance, instead of responding to the priest’s “The Lord be with you” with “And also with you,” the response became: “And with your spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The seemingly small modification sparked an uproar so fierce that some leaders warned of a “ritual whiplash.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new wording has stayed intact, but that outsize reaction did not surprise ritual scholars. “The ritual reflects the sacred values of the group,” says Juliana Schroeder, a social psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley. “Those [ritual actions] are nonnegotiable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic, people are being forced to renegotiate rituals large and small. Cruelly, a pandemic that has taken more than half a million lives worldwide has disrupted cherished funeral and grieving rituals.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Even when rituals can be tweaked to fit the moment, such as virtual religious services or car parades in place of graduation ceremonies, the experiences don’t carry the same emotional heft as the real thing. That’s because the immutability of rituals — their fixed and often repetitive nature — is core to their definition, Schroeder and others say. So too is the symbolic meaning people attach to behaviors; doing the ritual “right” can matter more than the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why do such behaviors even exist? Anthropologists, psychologists and neuroscientists have all weighed in, so much so that the theories used to explain the purpose of rituals feel as myriad as the forms rituals have taken the world over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That growing body of research can help explain the unrest people are now experiencing as beloved rituals go virtual or get punted to some unsettled future. Multiple lines of evidence suggest, for instance, that rituals help with emotional regulation, particularly during periods of uncertainty, when control over events is not within reach. Rituals also foster social cohesion. Engaging in rituals, in other words, could really help people and societies navigate this new and fraught global landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is exactly the time … when we want to be able to congregate with other people, get social support and engage in the kinds of collective rituals that promote cooperation [and] reduce anxiety,” says developmental psychologist Cristine Legare of the University of Texas at Austin. And yet, with COVID-19, congregating in any sort of group can be downright dangerous. What does that mean for how we persevere?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;An illusion of control&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Polish-born British anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski documented rituals and speculated on their reason for being in the early 1900s. Living among fishermen on the Trobriand Islands off New Guinea from 1915 to 1918, Malinowski noticed that when the fishermen stuck to the safe and reliable lagoon, they described their successes and failures in terms of skill and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when venturing into deeper waters, the fishermen practiced rituals during all stages of the journey, acts Malinowski collectively referred to as “magic.” Before setting out, the men consumed special herbs and sacrificed pigs. While on the water, the fishermen beat the canoe with banana leaves, applied body paint, blew on conch shells and chanted in synchrony. Malinowski later used that Trobriand data to comment more broadly on human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We find magic wherever the elements of chance and accident, and the emotional play between hope and fear, have a wide and extensive range. We do not find magic whenever the pursuit is certain, reliable and well under control of rational methods,” Malinowski wrote in an essay published posthumously in 1948.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Working in the late 1960s and early 1970s, American anthropologist Roy Rappaport built on that idea by developing a social framework for ritual, theorizing that such behaviors help individuals and groups maintain a balanced psychological state — much like a thermostat system that controls when the heat kicks on. In recent decades, anthropologists and psychologists have tested the idea that rituals regulate emotions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2002, during a period of intense fighting between Palestine and Israel, anthropologist Richard Sosis took a taxi from Jerusalem to Tzfat, in northern Israel. Sosis, of the University of Connecticut in Storrs, noticed that the driver was carrying the Hebrew Bible’s Book of Psalms despite professing little religious inclination and admitting he didn’t read it. The driver said the book was there for his protection. Sosis suspected that the mere presence of the book helped the cabdriver manage the stress of possibly violent encounters. But how?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few years later, Sosis and his team recruited 115 Orthodox Jewish women from Tzfat to take part in a study about psalm reading. By the time interviews began in August 2006, war between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah had broken out; 71 percent of the women in the study had fled Tzfat for central Israel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers asked the women to list their three top stressors during the war. The women listed many of the same issues, with a few important differences. Almost 76 percent of those who stayed in Tzfat reported concerns about property damage compared with just 11 percent of women who left. Women who left were more likely than women who stayed to worry about stressors associated with displacement, such as inadequate child care (32 percent versus 9 percent) and a lack of schedule (32 percent compared with 6 percent).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also had the women fill out a questionnaire about anxiety. Psalm reading provided anxiety relief, but the psalms’ true power depended on the women’s location. That is, the anxiety scores of women who left Tzfat and recited psalms were only slightly lower than the scores of women who left but did not recite psalms. The anxiety scores of women who stayed in Tzfat and recited psalms, on the other hand, were more than 50 percent lower than women who stayed and did not recite psalms. Overall, those who remained in Tzfat and recited psalms &lt;a href=&quot;https://richard-sosis.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2243/2018/06/2011-Sosis-Psalms-and-Coping-with-Uncertainty.pdf&quot;&gt;had lower anxiety scores than those who left&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When psalms help &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking at psalm reading and anxiety levels among Orthodox Jewish women who stayed or fled war-torn Tzfat, Israel, in 2006, researchers found that anxiety scores were similar among women who read sacred texts and nonreaders who left, and nonreaders who stayed. But the anxiety levels of women in the war zone who read psalms were much lower than the other groups’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Psalm reading helps when circumstances seem out of control&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Reciting the psalms was effective under conditions in which the stressor was uncontrollable. But once you could devise instrumental solutions to a problem, such as taking care of your kids or finding work, reciting psalms isn’t going to fix anything,” says Sosis, whose findings appeared in &lt;em&gt;American Anthropologist&lt;/em&gt; in 2011. Several more recent studies conducted on individuals living in war and earthquake zones mirror Sosis’ finding that rituals give participants a sense — or a comforting illusion — of control over the uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Testing the illusion&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have begun testing the psychological benefits of rituals using controlled experiments and physiological monitors. In one study, Dimitris Xygalatas, an anthropologist and psychologist also at the University of Connecticut, and colleagues recruited 74 Hindu women in southwest Mauritius. Thirty-two women were sent to a lab and the rest to the local temple. All participants completed a survey evaluating their overall anxiety and were fitted with heart rate monitors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers elicited anxiety among the women by giving them three minutes to put together a speech on their flood preparedness — natural disasters are a common threat to the island — to ostensibly be evaluated later by government experts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Afterward, women at the temple performed their usual routine — praying to Hindu deities and offering fruits and flowers. These actions tended to follow the same pattern across participants, such as holding an oil lamp or incense stick and moving it slowly clockwise before the statue of a deity. Women at the lab, meanwhile, sat quietly for 11 minutes, about the same time it took for the other women to pray. All participants then took a second anxiety survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Offering to Lakshmi&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090324&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081520_sg_rituals_inline2-1_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090324&quot;&gt;D. XYGALATAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;In Mauritius, many women regularly pay tribute to the gods in the Hindu pantheon, such as this woman making an offering to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. 
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the first survey, both groups reported similar levels of anxiety. But the women who then performed their rituals at the temple reported half as much anxiety as the women in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That divergence also showed up on the heart monitors, specifically on a marker for resilience known as heart rate variability. During periods of stress, heart rate becomes less variable and the time between beats gets shorter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spacing between heartbeats for women who sat quietly increased only about 3 percent from the baseline rate, measured when the women first arrived at the lab. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2019.0431?af=R&quot;&gt;for women who performed the ritual and experienced stress reduction&lt;/a&gt;, the space between beats lengthened 22 percent from the baseline rate, Xygalatas and colleagues reported in the Aug. 17 &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&lt;/em&gt;. That is, heart rate variability was 30 percent higher among women performing the ritual than women who sat quietly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mauritius worshippers&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090323&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081520_sg_rituals_inline2-2_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090323&quot;&gt;Worshippers in Mauritius hold trays bearing fruits and flowers as gifts to gods in the Hindu pantheon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090323&quot;&gt;D. Xygalatas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xygalatas’ and Sosis’ studies suggest that engaging in the individual, repetitive rituals often seen in religious practices, such as reading psalms or reciting prayers, could serve as a balm during the pandemic. But, typically, even individual rituals carry a social component. For instance, it was common for women in Sosis’ study to divvy up the 150 passages so that they could read the entire Book of Psalms in a single day. “Women recognize that other women are also engaging in these psalm-recitation activities,” Sosis says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers largely concur that the power of rituals rests within a larger social fabric. Rituals “are created by groups, and individuals inherit them,” Legare says. The problem is, during the pandemic, even if people are engaging in rituals on their own, those larger groups are now fractured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Merging with the in-group&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that rituals serve to bond individuals is not new. Fourteenth century scholar Ibn Khaldūn used the term &lt;em&gt;asabiyah&lt;/em&gt;, Arabic for solidarity, to describe the social cohesion that emerges from engaging in collective rituals. Khaldūn believed that solidarity had its foundations in kinship but extended to tribes and even nations. Centuries later, in the early 1900s, French sociologist Émile Durkheim theorized that group rituals fostered unity among practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contemporary times, researchers have sought to understand the ways in which rituals bind people together. Work by University of Oxford anthropologist Harvey Whitehouse suggests that rituals exist on either side of a dichotomy. On one side are “imagistic” rituals that fuse people together, often more tightly than kin, through intense moments and painful rites of passage, such as piercing or tattooing one’s body and walking on fire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, imagistic rituals are much less common than the “doctrinal” rituals that characterize modern-day life — prayers, religious services and various regimented rites of passage, such as baby showers and birthday parties. Such rituals appear to have become established as societies grew increasingly complex with the emergence of agriculture. While not binding people as tightly as imagistic rituals, doctrinal rituals enable group members to both identify those in their larger group and spot and police social deviants, Whitehouse says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several studies of contemporary communities support the idea that doctrinal rituals help unite social groups. In the early 2000s, Sosis compared cooperation among members of secular versus religious collective farming settlements, called kibbutzim, in Israel. The two types of kibbutzim operated in similar ways, except that men in the religious settlements were required to pray in groups of 10 or more people at least three times a day. Women also prayed, but did not have to do so collectively. Sosis reported in &lt;em&gt;Current Anthropology&lt;/em&gt; in 2003 that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/379260&quot;&gt;members of religious kibbutzim were more cooperative&lt;/a&gt;, as evidenced by taking less money out of a communal pot, than members of secular kibbutzim. That difference was driven entirely by those ritual-practicing men in the religious kibbutzim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In her research, Legare — who invents rituals to see how children understand such practices — has shown that children use rituals to identify and reinforce connections with members of their own group while shunning those outside the group. Recently, Legare, working with Nicole Wen, now at Brunel University London, divided 60 children, ages 4 to 11, into two groups. The children were given wristbands denoting their group’s color. One group was then walked through a highly scripted, ritualized process to make a bead necklace with prompts like: “First, hold up a green string. Then, touch a green star to your head. Then, string on a green star” and so on. The other group made necklaces with the same materials, but no script.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The activities continued for two weeks, during which the researchers measured how long children spent comparing their handiwork to that of members of their own group and how long they spent watching members of the other group, such as by looking over their shoulders. Reporting in the Aug. 17 &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&lt;/em&gt;, the team found that during the experiment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0437&quot;&gt;children in the ritual group spent on average twice as much time&lt;/a&gt; as children in the nonritual group showing off their necklaces to members of their own group and monitoring the behavior of those not in the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 96px; font-weight: 300; margin: 10px; line-height: 70%;&quot;&gt;2X&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Extra time that children who beaded necklaces using rituals, compared with children who beaded necklaces without ritual, spent showing off their handiwork and checking out the work of the other group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Working in a group helps people bond even without a script to follow, Legare says. But “rituals take the effects of a group experience and turn them way up.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Legare’s project and others also illustrate how rituals engender in-groups and out-groups. Whitehouse’s work suggests that shared traumatic experiences, which may include imagistic rituals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-studies-explore-why-ordinary-people-turn-terrorist&quot;&gt;contribute to the cohesion of terrorist cell networks&lt;/a&gt;, where fighters would sooner die for fellow fighters than even family (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/9/16, p. 18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic itself is the latest example of how a shared traumatic experience and the resulting rituals — Zoom parties, alliances around wearing or eschewing masks and reactions to civil rights rallies — can break or bind communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Human social groups … [are] always going to be vulnerable to in-group preferences and out-group biases,” Legare says. Whether we use ritual for good — or evil — is up to us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Pandemic asynchrony&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certain rituals, such as singing and dancing together, are particularly good at amplifying group cohesion and a spirit of generosity. But these group rituals, tragically, also can spread the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On March 10 in Skagit County, Wash., 61 members of a church choir met for practice. One singer, who had been feeling unwell for a few days, later tested positive for COVID-19. Within weeks, almost 90 percent of those in attendance had developed similar symptoms, with 33 confirmed cases; two members died from the disease. Similar stories &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening&quot;&gt;linking choir practice to superspreading events have emerged&lt;/a&gt;. And the collective singing that characterizes so many religious services has emerged as a particularly risky activity in this pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a series of experiments reported in 2013, researchers tested to see if dancing or chanting together made people feel more generous toward members of their group. One of the tests divided 27 volunteers into groups of three and handed them a list of one-syllable words divided into three columns. The researchers told some of the groups to go down the list and chant the words together for six minutes, keeping in beat with a metronome — effectively a ritual performed in synchrony. Other groups recited the words sequentially, with each member reading the words in only one column.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants then played a cooperative game within their groups. Anonymously, each member could choose either option X, a guaranteed prize of $7, or option Y, a prize of $10 that came through only if every group member chose Y. If a single member chose X, no one would get money. Reporting in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737148/&quot;&gt;62 percent of participants who chanted together chose Y&lt;/a&gt; compared with just 21 percent who chanted in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;One for all &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants who chanted as a group at the same time were more cooperative when playing a game after the chanting than those who chanted words sequentially. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Synchronous chanting increases cooperation&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Synchronous chanting increases cooperation graph&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090317&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081520_sg_rituals_inline3_desktop_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090317&quot;&gt;C. Chang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other synchronized activities, such as marching, dancing, rowing and even collective social distancing while out in public, can bond participants, Whitehouse says. The alliance forged by synchrony is arguably playing out across the United States even now as both Black and non-Black people march and chant in unison &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-reform-why-little-evidence-data-body-cameras-implicit-bias&quot;&gt;to protest police brutality&lt;/a&gt; and systemic racism. In any context, Legare says, synchrony “is a powerful social catalyst.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;New rituals&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ironically, as the pandemic makes practicing rituals, particularly social rituals, profoundly challenging, decades of research have made clear that people turn to such regimented behaviors during periods of unrest. “Anthropologists have long observed that during times of anxiety, you see spikes in ritual activity,” Xygalatas says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So even as rituals are being disrupted and diluted, people are seeking new sources of solace. Many people, for instance, are turning to their immediate family members to fill that ritual void.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that lockdowns are actually leading to the invention of new family rituals that foster this kind of resilience, ranging from the arrangement of rainbows and teddy bears in windows to the revival of more traditional family rituals like eating, singing [and] telling stories together,” Whitehouse says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People are also finding new ways to experience old traditions. Rachel Fraumann, a Methodist minister in Barre, Vt., says online attendance at her recorded sermons has more than doubled since mid-March. In her view, now is a great time for the ritually and spiritually adrift to shop around for their ritual fit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such “shopping” doesn’t need to occur within a religious context. Secular rituals, such as those centered around crafts, music or sports, have shown similar promises, and pitfalls, as religious activities, says Oxford cognitive anthropologist Martha Newson. Which means now could be a great time to try new hobbies with a solo component as a way to practice in the here and now, with a group component to look forward to after the pandemic ends, such as knitting with the goal of joining a knitting circle or buying a rowing machine to get fit enough to join the local crew team, where bodies move in sync.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Creating rituals outside of religion, though, can be hard to get right. “It’s not the hobby, it’s the people who do the hobby who make the tribe. Precisely what the magic ingredients are for that, we [don’t] know,” Newson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those challenges won’t stop people from trying once the pandemic ends, Legare says. “I would predict that there will be an increase in attending religious services but [also] an increase in attending all kinds of social group activities. People are so starved for social interaction, I would predict increased enrollment in absolutely everything.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Bringing rival groups together to reduce prejudices is not a new idea. But can positive contact help ethnic groups reconcile after extreme violence? A social scientist tested that idea in Iraq by putting Christians and Muslims on the same soccer teams. The resulting camaraderie among players did &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/866&quot;&gt;help bridge those communities&lt;/a&gt; — but only to a point&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Relations between Muslims and Christians disintegrated in northern Iraq after the Islamic State took over Mosul and surrounding regions in 2014. Some 100,000 Christians from Mosul alone were among those who fled their homes, returning years later to live uneasily alongside Muslim residents who they saw as complicit in the attacks. Political scientist Salma Mousa of Stanford University, an avid soccer fan who grew up in the Middle East, wondered if the popular sport could bring those communities together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Players did make small behavioral changes on the field, but that didn’t translate to broader attitudinal shifts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, at the end of the two-month league, roughly 61 percent of Christian players on mixed teams agreed to register for mixed teams the following season, compared with 47 percent of players on all-Christian teams, Mousa reports in the Aug. 14 &lt;em&gt;Science.&lt;/em&gt; Almost 54 percent of Christian players on mixed teams voted for a Muslim newcomer to win a sportsmanship award, given to a person not on their own team, compared with about 31 percent of players on all-Christian teams. And when researchers contacted players six months later, about 61 percent of Christian players from mixed teams were training with Muslim players at least once a week compared with 17 percent of players from the all-Christian teams.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But Mousa did not find that sort of interethnic camaraderie off the field. For instance, even after being given an $8 voucher to a Muslim-owned restaurant in Mosul, Christian players from mixed teams weren’t any more likely than players from segregated teams to make the 40-minute drive. Nor did these Christian players’ attitudes toward Muslims in general change much on surveys taken at the start and culmination of the league.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was hoping … contact would solve everything,” Mousa says. “At first I was disappointed, but then I actually started to think it is a win to even have this positive dent” in improving relations between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mousa’s research hinges on the “contact hypothesis,” the idea that positive interactions among rival group members can reduce prejudices. That idea underlies many global peacekeeping efforts, with the U.S. Agency for International Development allocating $877 million in 2020 alone to “social cohesion” programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The soccer experiment is the first known study of the contact hypothesis showing that contact can &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb9990&quot;&gt;shift real-world behavior&lt;/a&gt;, behavioral psychologists Elizabeth Levy Paluck and Chelsey Clark of Princeton University write in a commentary in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recreational adult soccer teams in northern Iraq are already segregated by religion. So Mousa invited Christian soccer teams in two cities in the region, Ankawa and Qaraqosh, to participate in her experiment, eventually recruiting 51 teams to create four leagues. Most teams received either three new Christian or Muslim players to play alongside nine Christian players already on the team, thus creating a mix of interfaith teams and all-Christian teams. All the Muslim players had also been displaced by ISIS to ensure that Christians did not team up with ISIS fighters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mousa soon observed camaraderie developing among players on mixed teams. On one team, members pooled their money to defray the cost of taxis for Muslim players traveling across town to practice; another team elected a Muslim player as captain. But when Mousa surveyed Christian players on mixed and segregated teams to see if their attitudes toward Muslims in general had shifted, she saw little to no change. For instance, Christians on mixed teams were no more likely than those on all-Christian teams to feel comfortable having Muslims as neighbors. Mousa likewise saw no shift in attitudes on the pre- and postsurveys among the Muslim players.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mousa’s project adds to evidence suggesting, counterintuitively, that shifting people’s behavior toward rival groups may be easier than shifting their attitudes, says political scientist Michael Gilligan of New York University. Arguably, changing how rivals act toward one another matters more anyway, he says. “It gives you hope that if this becomes a ramped-up program that is done throughout these areas, they may actually have a [big] impact.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cells-mice-sense-multiple-taste-buds"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Taste buds can turn food from mere fuel into a memorable meal. Now researchers have discovered a set of supersensing cells in the taste buds of mice that can detect four of the five flavors that the buds recognize. Bitter, sweet, sour and umami — these cells can catch them all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s a surprise because it’s commonly thought that taste cells are very specific, detecting just one or two flavors. Some known taste cells respond to only one compound, for instance, detecting sweet sucralose or bitter caffeine. But the new results suggest that a far more complicated process is at work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When neurophysiologist Debarghya Dutta Banik and colleagues turned off the sensing abilities of more specific taste cells in mice, the researchers were startled to find other cells responding to flavors. Pulling those cells out of the rodents’ taste buds and giving them a taste of several compounds revealed a group of cells that can &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008925&quot;&gt;sense multiple chemicals&lt;/a&gt; across different taste classes, the team reports August 13 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We never expected that any population of [taste] cells would respond to so many different compounds,” says Dutta Banik, of the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But taste cells don’t respond to flavors in insolation; the brain and the tongue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/taste-all-your-head&quot;&gt;work together as tastemakers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/24/15&lt;/em&gt;). So the scientists monitored the brain to see if it received bitter, sweet or umami signals when mice lacked a key protein needed for these broadly tasting cells to relay information. Those observations revealed that without the protein, the brain didn’t get the flavor messages, which was also shown when mice slurped bitter solutions as though they were water even though the rodents hate bitter tastes, says Dutta Banik, who did the work at the University at Buffalo in New York.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these broadly sensing cells were incommunicado, the brain also seemed to miss signals from other more specific taste cells, such as those for sensing bitterness. So it may be that the broadly sensing cells work with the others to communicate taste information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The presence of these [newly discovered] cells completely disrupts how people think the taste bud works,” says Kathryn Medler, a neurophysiologist at the University at Buffalo in New York.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Life without functioning taste cells would be beyond bland. Taste is crucial for survival, Medler says. When taste diminishes, with age or after treatments such as chemotherapy, people can lose their appetites and become malnourished. A working sense of taste also helps protect us from eating something spoiled or toxic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since taste works similarly in mice and humans, Medler says, untangling how such cells work may someday help scientists bring the flavor back for people who have lost the sense of taste.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The long-term implications are pretty profound,” says Stephen Roper, a neurobiologist at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla., who was not involved with the work. Learning how these cells sense and how information passes between them, the buds and the brain, he says, could someday allow people to engineer taste signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;People living in southern Africa around 200,000 years ago not only slept on grass bedding but occasionally burned it, apparently to keep from going buggy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remnants of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abc7239&quot;&gt;oldest known grass bedding&lt;/a&gt;, discovered in South Africa’s Border Cave, lay on the ashes of previously burned bedding, say archaeologist Lyn Wadley of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and her colleagues. Ash spread beneath bound bunches of grass may have been used to repel crawling, biting insects, which cannot easily move through fine powder, the researchers report in the Aug. 14 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Wadley’s team also found bits of burned wood in the bedding containing fragments of camphor leaves, an aromatic plant that can be used as a bug repellent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6061/1388.abstract&quot;&gt;Prior to this new find, the oldest plant bedding&lt;/a&gt; — mainly consisting of sedge leaves, ash and aromatic plants likely used to keep insects away — dated to around 77,000 years ago at South Africa’s Sibudu rock-shelter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Border Cave, chemical and microscopic analyses of excavated sediment showed that a series of beds had been assembled from grasses, such as Guinea grass and red grass. Guinea grass currently grows at Border Cave’s entrance. Bedding past its prime was likely burned in small fire pits, the researchers suspect. Remains of fire pits were found not far from Border Cave’s former grass beds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Grass fragments uncovered in South African cave&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090435&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081320_BB_grass_inline.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090435&quot;&gt;Preserved grass fragments uncovered in a South African cave, left, are by far the oldest known examples of grass bedding, researchers say. Close-up images of those fragments taken by a scanning electron microscope, such as the one shown at right, helped to narrow down what type of grasses were used for bedding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090435&quot;&gt;L. Wadley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans in southern Africa intentionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ashes-oldest-controlled-fire&quot;&gt;lit fires by around 1 million years ago&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/2/12&lt;/em&gt;). But Border Cave provides the first evidence that ancient grass bedding was burned on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Small, sharpened stones were also found among grass and ash remains, suggesting that people occasionally sat on cave bedding while making stone tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen the government take measures to try and limit people’s consumption of sugary drinks and other unhealthy foods. Take the so-called “sugar tax” placed on soft drinks, for instance, or the proposal to ban adverts for junk food before the 9pm watershed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some psychologists hope that small changes in design can also help “nudge” people into healthier behaviours. For example, a study from last year found that the order in which drinks are presented on the McDonald’s menu could &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/19/simply-changing-the-order-of-fast-food-menus-nudges-customers-towards-healthier-soft-drink-choices/&quot;&gt;encourage people to choose the sugar-free options&lt;/a&gt; more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70278-6&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; suggests that the shape of a glass could also subtly influence people’s drinking behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40050&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past work had found that people were slower to drink both beer and soft drinks from glasses with straight sides compared to those with outward-sloping sides. But it was unclear whether there was any effect on the total amount consumed or exactly &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the shape of a glass should have an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, Tess Langfield from the University of Cambridge and colleagues conducted a series of experiments using different shaped glasses. First, the team gave 198 participants a fizzy apple drink in either a straight-sided tumbler, or one with sides that sloped outwards. The participants were allowed to drink at their leisure while watching a nature documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_40053&quot; style=&quot;width: 823px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Langfield et al (2020)&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-40053&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;40053&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Langfield et al (2020)&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png?w=823&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;823,398&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/13/the-shape-of-a-glass-can-influence-how-much-we-drink/langfield-et-al-2020/&quot; height=&quot;398&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png&quot; width=&quot;823&quot; /&gt;The glasses used in the first study (left; each glass contains 330ml of apple drink) and second and third studies (right; each glass contains 165ml of passion fruit drink). Via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70278-6&quot;&gt;Langfield et al (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found no difference in the total time participants spent drinking from each kind of glass. But those who drank from the sloping glass did show a more “decelerated” pattern of drinking: they tended to drink more of the drink in the first half of the session than the second half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were then asked to fill the glass until it was half-full. Those with the sloping glass tended to underestimate where the midpoint was compared to those with the straight-sided glass. That makes sense: if a glass slopes outwards, there is more volume at the top than at the bottom, so the midpoint is higher that it might initially seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest glass shape could influence people’s pace of drinking, and potentially their perceptions of how much they’ve had to drink. But they don’t reveal anything about the actual amount consumed. So in a second study, the team asked participants to perform a (fake) taste-test, rating four passion fruit drinks, half served in straight-sided champagne flutes and half in sloped martini glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants did indeed drink significantly less from the champagne flutes than the martini glasses. They also took smaller sips from the champagne flutes. This time, however, glass shape didn’t influence people’s accuracy at finding the midpoint of the glass, suggesting that this kind of perceptual bias couldn’t explain why people drank less from the straight-sided glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers wondered whether the results could be related to the physical shape of the lips when sipping from each kind of glass. So in a final experiment, they had participants drink from the champagne and martini glasses while their face was rigged up with electrodes to measure muscle activity. The team found that people’s lips were more pursed when sipping from the straight-sided flute than the sloped martini glass, and there was some evidence that pursing the lips more was related to taking smaller sips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, then, the study suggests that sloping glasses can cause us to drink more of a soft drink — but this seems to be due to the way the shape affects the actual mechanics of how we sip from a glass, rather than the result of perceptual biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So should health-conscious bars and restaurants start chucking out their sloping glasses? Well, it seems pretty clear that more work needs to be done in real world settings. Drinking in a bogus taste-test in the lab — particularly when hooked up to electrodes — is a far cry from how people might consume soft drinks in daily life. And it remains unclear whether the results hold for alcohol as well as soft drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two studies also used glasses which normally have quite specific purposes: they’re used for serving sparkling wine and cocktails. Could participants’ associations with those drinks have influenced their behaviour? Maybe they’re used to sipping slowly on champagne, for instance, while more readily knocking back martinis. Unlikely, perhaps, but it seems worth also exploring the effects of glasses with novel designs that are free from these kinds of existing associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the study shows that the design of our drinkware is worth examining in the context of public health. And even small “nudges” could theoretically have a large impact at a population level, particularly alongside other measures. “In combination with other behaviour change strategies, adopting straight-sided glasses may prove to be one intervention contributing to the many needed to reduce consumption of drinks that harm health,” the team concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70278-6&quot;&gt;Glass shape influences drinking behaviours in three laboratory experiments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In 2004, 16-year-old Cyntoia Brown shot and killed a man who paid her for sex – a position she was forced into by an older man who took advantage of her. Brown never denied shooting the man (in fact, she was the one who called the police the next day), but she claimed it was an act of self-defense because she believed the man was grabbing a gun to shoot her. Brown was charged and convicted of aggravated robbery and first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 2017 her case gained national attention when celebrities and others &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567789605/cyntoia-brown-case-highlights-how-child-sex-trafficking-victims-are-prosecuted&quot;&gt;petitioned&lt;/a&gt; for her clemency. In 2019 the Governor of Tennessee &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2019/08/07/749025458/cyntoia-brown-released-after-15-years-in-prison-for-murder&quot;&gt;granted clemency&lt;/a&gt; and Brown was released from prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Black girl, Brown ’s case, and others like hers, ultimately reflect the legacy of racism in the United States—a long legacy that can shape the life trajectory of racial minority youth, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742&quot;&gt;leading them at a vastly disproportionate rate toward involvement in the legal system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history of race-based oppression, intergenerational trauma, and resulting poverty puts racial minorities at risk for becoming victims. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2&quot;&gt;Child sex traffickers prey on already-vulnerable child victims&lt;/a&gt;, convincing them that they have no other options in life than to sell their bodies and that no one else will want them. Brown’s childhood was difficult. She was in and out of the juvenile justice system and eventually ran away and began living on the streets. There she began a relationship with an older man who abused, raped, and sold her as a prostitute. She was manipulated and disparaged by this man, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; her “some people were born whores, and that [she] was one… and nobody’d want [her] but him.” Fearing the beating and rape she expected if she returned to her abuser without money, Brown stole from the man she shot in self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once racial minority juveniles come into contact with the legal system, racism can exacerbate negative outcomes at many levels. For example, like laypeople, police officers’ stereotypes &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9&quot;&gt;can influence how they perceive and respond to juveniles of color&lt;/a&gt;, including the way officers interrogate those suspected of committing crimes. Racial minorities suffer from the added stress and anxiety associated with stereotype threat (i.e., concerns about being stereotyped as criminal because of their race), &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-10&quot;&gt;which may impair their ability to understand their Miranda Rights&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and pressure them to waive their rights&lt;/a&gt;—exactly what Brown did. She did not understand the value of having an attorney during her initial interrogations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racism’s legacy has also been fear and suspicion—the fear that white Americans have of African Americans in particular, even youngsters. Compared to white adolescents, racial minorities are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9&quot;&gt;often perceived&lt;/a&gt; as older and more mature than they actually are, and they are in turn blamed more for their actions. Psychological research has established that cognitive and psychosocial development is not fully developed until adulthood, leaving youth of all races more likely to engage in impulsive, risky decision making without considering the long-term consequences of their actions. But whereas white juveniles’ actions may be attributed to these developmental limitations, minority youth do not receive the same benefit of the doubt. Brown was not only Black and mature looking, but she also suffered from vulnerabilities that further impaired her cognitive functioning: Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (a form of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder), which impaired and delayed the development of various cognitive abilities, including her ability to control her behavior and to understand the consequences of her actions. She was cognitively not even as old as she actually was, and far younger than she appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are racial minority youth perceived as older and more culpable than white youth, but minority girls are stereotyped as promiscuous and deviant. As a result, girls of color who are subjected to sexual exploitation are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2&quot;&gt;often blamed&lt;/a&gt; for their own victimization and labeled as offenders, not victims. Moreover, when they are charged with crimes, they are also &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11&quot;&gt;more likely to be tried in adult criminal court&lt;/a&gt; rather than a rehabilitation-oriented juvenile court. Brown’s case was no different—rather than consider her a child victim of sexual exploitation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/cyntoia-brown-long-trafficked-enslaved-jailed-for-life-at-16-and-fighting-back&quot;&gt;Brown was labeled a teen prostitute and tried as an adult.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyntoia Brown’s case illustrates the multifaceted ways in which racism influences minority youth’s life experiences as well as their interactions with the legal system. Although much progress has been made to end racism in the United States, there is still much that needs to be done to ensure that all children, regardless of race or ethnicity, have an equal opportunity to live and thrive in society. Meanwhile, social science has much to offer in exposing the legacies of racism in the legal context, and developing ways to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/fence-freedom-prison-hands-fingers-2163951/&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by Fifaliana-joy via Pixabay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/cyntoia-brown-and-the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-in-the-legal-system/&quot;&gt;Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633364024/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633364024/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-education-could-reduce-corruption/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How education could reduce corruption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/the-criminal-justice-systems-big-data-problem/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The criminal justice system’s big data problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/food-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1&quot;&gt;Food security&lt;/a&gt; – or “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life” – is a leading determinant of health. Food insecure adults (i.e., those without access to adequate food) experience poor nutrition, obesity, and chronic inflammation. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, food insecurity is associated with leading causes of death and disability—including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women disproportionately experience food insecurity, and sexual minority women (i.e., lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior; SMW) may be at greater risk. SMW experience discrimination due to their minority gender and sexual orientation that depletes their access to employment, living wages, and social supports. The systematic disruption of these economic resources may place SMW at greater risk for experiencing economic instability and related concerns, including food insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several solutions exist to alleviate food insecurity in the general population. In the United States (U.S.), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly, “food stamps”; SNAP) is a means-based program that provides financial assistance to participating low- and no- income households. SNAP participation reduces food insecurity in the general population, and may be an effective tool to reduce food insecurity in SMW. At the local level, emergency food assistance (e.g., food pantries, soup kitchens) are provided by non-profit and religious organizations to provide in-kind nutrition assistance to individuals and families in need, regardless of income. However, emergency food assistance is not associated with long-term reductions in food insecurity. Few studies have investigated differences in SNAP use and emergency food assistance by sexual orientation; as such, it is not known how these resources may be leveraged to address food insecurity in SMW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used publicly available data from the 2005-2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm&quot;&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; (NHANES) to investigate the prevalence of food insecurity and food assistance (SNAP use and emergency food assistance) in women, by sexual orientation. Data collected from 7,279 women was weighted to derive U.S. population-representative estimates. Of all respondents, 90.4% identified as exclusively heterosexual, 5.1% identified as heterosexual but also reported having sex with women, 3.4% identified as bisexual, and 1.2% identified as lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food insecurity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 25% of SMW experienced food insecurity over the past 12-months (vs 13.1% of exclusively heterosexual women). Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity (27.3%) followed by lesbian women (25.5%). Alarmingly, compared to exclusively heterosexual women, SMW were 50-84% more likely to experience at least one period during the past 12-months where eating patterns were disrupted and food intake was reduced due to lack of money or other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food assistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 20% of SMW reported using the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly referred to as “food stamps”) in the past 12-months; however, in fully adjusted models, the prevalence rate of women using SNAP did not differ by sexual orientation. This finding is in contrast to &lt;a href=&quot;https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-food-insecurity-snap/&quot;&gt;prior studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found differences in SNAP use by sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency food participation has not been explored in previous population-based studies of food insecurity in sexual minority populations. In our study, lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women. However, heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior were also 43% more likely to report past 12-month use of emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing disparities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is among the first to document disparities in food insecurity and emergency food assistance in SMW. Our results highlight inequities faced by SMW in accessing adequate and nutritious food. This is especially concerning as SMW’s increased rates of food insecurity may contribute to chronic disease disparities—including cancer and diabetes—seen in this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results suggest a need for culturally-specific interventions to reduce food insecurity disparities. One solution is to increase SNAP participation by SMW. By partnering with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations, public health departments may use targeted marketing and outreach to increase awareness of SNAP requirements and enrollment among food insecure SMW. For SMW who do not qualify for SNAP, local solutions may include increasing access to LGBT-specific food pantries sponsored by community-based organizations and improving the variety, amount, and nutrition of food distributed by these resources.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following press release was issued on Wednesday, August 12 at 8am Pacific.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (August 12, 2020) — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and LibLynx announced a partnership today to develop ground-breaking analytics that better communicate the usage and impact of Open Access (OA) content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A critical component in the development of sustainable funding models for OA is the ability to communicate impact in ways that are meaningful to a diverse range of internal and external stakeholders, including institutional partners, funders, and authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While traditional paywall publishers can take advantage of industry standard COUNTER reports to communicate usage to subscribing libraries, no similar standard exists for OA content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of the great benefits of our Open Access agreements with institutions is the development of next generation metrics for native-OA content,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships, PLOS. “LibLynx is a crucial collaborator and thought leader in this space and we’re eager to build upon existing COUNTER-compliant metrics and share new approaches to reporting with the broader OA community”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new approaches will provide stakeholders with reports customized to meet their changing needs and underpin the development of new business models. Reports will be trialed and piloted with the PLOS community over the next 6 to 12 months, contributing to the development of future standards in this area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Together LibLynx and PLOS have a unique opportunity to develop new metrics for evaluating open access content — an emerging need for libraries and consortia as they work to evaluate the benefits of transformative and native-open access publishing agreements,” said Tim Lloyd, CEO, LibLynx. “Our depth and breadth of experience in this arena, along with the organizational data available from PSI Metrics, will help provide PLOS and their partners access to real-time, on-demand reporting on the impact of their content.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be familiar with the concept of the “successful psychopath”. Like regular psychopaths, such people are callous and manipulative, self-seeking, and free from guilt — but rather than ending up behind bars, they are able to flourish in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, though the concept of the successful psychopath is popular, it’s also contentious. That’s because there’s been a lack of data to substantiate it, or to explain it. But now, ten years after &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/08/18/hunting-the-successful-psychopath/&quot;&gt;an initial study hinted that levels of the personality trait of conscientiousness might be important&lt;/a&gt; for understanding the path to “successful” vs criminal psychopathy, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45069-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment&lt;/em&gt;, provides more robust support for that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40043&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work published back in 2010 started with a survey of psychology and law specialists, criminal attorneys and professors of clinical psychology in the US. These people were asked if they’d ever known someone who matched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hare.org&quot;&gt;Robert Hare’s definition of a psychopath&lt;/a&gt;, but who was successful in life. If so, they were asked to provide personality and psychopathy assessments for them. One key difference between successful and standard psychopaths emerged: successful psychopaths were reported as having higher levels of conscientiousness. Rather than being impulsive and irresponsible, they seemed to be more self-disciplined and driven to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conclusion was based solely on reports of people who thought they knew someone who fitted the bill, however. Now Emily Lasko and David S. Chester at Virginia Commonwealth University have studied relatively successful vs unsuccessful psychopathic individuals directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair used a total of seven years of data on 1,354 American adolescent offenders for their study. As all of these adolescents had initially committed a serious offence (such as sexual assault or a weapons offence), the “successful” vs “unsuccessful” distinction was tied to re-offending. Adolescents who did not re-offend were classed as “successful”, whereas those who’d re-offended at least once were deemed to be “unsuccessful”. Every six months during the study, the adolescents completed surveys of psychopathic traits and also separate measures of their ability to control their impulses and suppress feelings of aggression, as well as self-reporting any offences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasko and Chester found that participants who’d initially scored highly for grandiose-manipulative psychopathic traits (traits associated with arrogance and self-centredness as well as manipulativeness) went on to show steeper increases over time in two forms of conscientiousness: impulse control and the suppression of aggression. Importantly, this effect was notably larger within the “successful” group. It seems, then, that successful psychopaths are those who show real improvements at controlling their impulses, to achieve their goals. “This exacerbated development of conscientiousness-defining traits is likely able to compensate for the heightened antisocial tendencies of these psychopathic individuals, bringing them into a self-regulatory balance that enables them to function in society,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team tried altering the number of re-offences that led to an individual being categorised as successful vs unsuccessful, but this did not materially change the pattern of the results. As an alternative measure of “success”, they also considered whether or not participants were enrolled in school at each time point. The link between conscientiousness-related traits and success held. “This suggests that our findings are likely to generalise across various forms of ‘success’,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, more work will be needed to investigate the factors contributing to the development of greater or poorer impulse control, and how to enhance it in this population, perhaps to increase the proportion of relatively successful rather than criminal psychopaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, the research supports the idea of “successful” vs regular psychopaths, as well as finding evidence for a key difference between the two. “These findings show the importance of the five-factor model to understanding the nuances of psychopathy and its various phenotypes,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45069-001&quot;&gt;What makes a “successful” psychopath? Longitudinal trajectories of offenders’ antisocial behavior and impulse control as a function of psychopathy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friendship tends to be based on some kind of shared experience: growing up with someone, working with them, or having the same interests. Politics is an important factor too, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721413510932&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that we can be pretty intolerant of those with different political positions — not an ideal starting point for friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can have a significant and tangible impact. One Reuters/Ipsos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-relationships-insight/from-disputes-to-a-breakup-wounds-still-raw-after-u-s-election-idUSKBN15M13L&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found 16.4% of people had stopped talking to a family member or friend after Trump was elected, while 17.4% had blocked someone they care about on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens when you find out a trusted friend has different politics to you? They don’t fare well, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407520939191&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Social and Personal Relationships&lt;/em&gt; authored by Elena Buliga and Cara MacInnis from the University of Calgary, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40038&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were recruited from across the political spectrum: 70 identified as Republicans, whilst 142 described themselves as Democrats. As well as reporting their political identity, participants rated their opinions on social and economic policy, on a scale from very liberal (0) to very conservative (10). They also rated how important their political orientation is to their identity and completed a “feeling thermometer”, which measured  how favourably or unfavourably they felt towards members of other political parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the pre-test measures were complete, participants were presented with four vignettes in a random order. In the first, participants were asked to imagine meeting someone at a party with the same political views as them; another vignette detailed the same experience, only this time the potential friend had &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; political views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final two vignettes, participants were instructed to think about a real or hypothetical close friend whose views they were not already aware of and asked to imagine a conversation in which their friend outlined their political beliefs. In the first, participants imagined their friend espousing a shared political belief, while in the second they turned out to be a member of a political out-group instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading each of the four vignettes, participants rated how excited, happy, pleased, satisfied, surprised, upset, anxious and worried they would feel in the situation and answered questions on how willing they would be to maintain that friendship (e.g. “would you make an effort to spend time with this person?”). They also rated their trust and satisfaction in, and hope for, the ongoing friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants indicated how much they would expect their feelings to change towards the person in each vignette, as well as rating attitudes towards them from “extremely unfavourable” to “extremely favourable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, people were more positive towards in-group members than out-group members: participants had more trust in and hope for the longevity of relationships with both friends and strangers of the same political leanings as them than they did even for established friends with different politics. Positive emotions were highest when discovering a friend had shared beliefs, followed by the stranger with shared beliefs. Out-group friends and out-group strangers tailed behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative affect was also highest for the friend with different political views, followed by the out-group stranger. This makes sense — you’re likely to be much more invested (and therefore much more disappointed) in a friend than someone you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t clear, however, who exactly participants were imagining when asked to think of a friend, meaning there may have been significant variation in closeness and therefore in emotional response; some participants may also have been thinking of a hypothetical friend, which could also have had an impact on the results. The measures also only looked at immediate reactions — it’s very possible that after discovering a friend is of a different political persuasion,  participants could calm down or mellow out over a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably also important to note that the results aren’t necessarily going to represent every relationship — lots of people have cherished friends with very different politics to their own. &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; those relationships are successfully managed and navigated may be one focus for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407520939191&quot;&gt;“How do you like them now?” Expected reactions upon discovering that a friend is a political out-group member&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a new habit isn’t always easy — we probably only have to look at our own history of failed &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/&quot;&gt;New Year’s Resolutions&lt;/a&gt; to know that. One common frustration is that things don’t happen fast enough — we start doing something that’s supposedly good for us but don’t see a significant behaviour change as quickly as we’d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That certainly seems to be the case with exercise, at least according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01530/full&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology. &lt;/em&gt;It found that people only feel they’ve become more active when they increase the amount of &lt;em&gt;vigorous&lt;/em&gt; activity they do —  if it’s moderate, they don’t feel like they’ve changed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40034&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In the first study, Hermann Szymczak from the University of Konstanz and colleagues collected data from 605 participants taking part in a longitudinal study looking at health behaviour. First, participants were asked to report their physical activity for each of the last 7 days: vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity and walking. Six months later, participants also reported their perceived change in physical activity since the first time point, choosing one statement they felt best summed up their behaviour: “yes, I became more physically active”, “no, but I tried to become more physically active”, “no and I have not tried” and “no, because I was already physically active before”. At both time points, objective fitness was measured via a bicycle test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, the same data was gathered from 382 participants from two more time points in the longitudinal study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that those who said their behaviour had changed (“changers”) showed an increase in &lt;em&gt;vigorous&lt;/em&gt; activity of about 52 and 86 minutes per week in the first and second studies respectively. Changers did not exhibit any changes in &lt;em&gt;moderate&lt;/em&gt; activity, however. This suggests that an increase in intense physical activity is much more influential in making people feel that their behaviour has changed. (Changers also showed increased fitness in the bicycle test, at least in the first study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obvious ramifications to these findings. If people only see vigorous activity as a worthwhile endeavour, it could lead to some pushing themselves too hard — and it could put others off completely, meaning they lose the many benefits of even light exercise. Previous research has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-006-1014-4&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; this might be the case, so developing public service messaging that makes clear the health benefits of non-intense exercise might have a serious impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research could look at fitness norms — what narratives exist about moderate and intensive exercise, and how are they disseminated? This could go some way towards understanding &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people don’t feel a difference with moderate exercise, as well as informing any changes in messaging to boost motivation and encourage even small behaviour changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the team also notes, perceived behaviour change is a key part of actual behaviour change: if people see positive developments in themselves or their skills, they’re both more likely to believe the changes will last and more able to commit. Thinking about and implementing small changes in behaviour, therefore, may be particularly useful if you’re looking to maintain a habit in the long term. And if you’re feeling bad about a day or week off exercise? Don’t worry — vegging out is just as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/16/forgive-yourself-for-relaxing-in-front-of-the-tv-and-the-couch-time-might-actually-do-you-some-good/&quot;&gt;necessary&lt;/a&gt; sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01530/full&quot;&gt;An Increase in Vigorous but Not Moderate Physical Activity Makes People Feel They Have Changed Their Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;One death every 52 minutes occurs in the United States as a direct result of an eating disorder, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/striped/report-economic-costs-of-eating-disorders/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders, the Academy for Eating Disorders, and Deloitte Access Economics. I have studied eating disorders for over 30 years, and I was shocked by this finding. From 2018-2019, roughly 6,910 females and 3,290 males between the ages of 15 and 64 years lost their lives due to an eating disorder. The personal tragedy for each family member and friend is beyond the scope of even the most comprehensive study of social and economic costs of eating disorders. But the economic cost of these deaths came to $8.8 billion dollars ($8,800,000,000.00), dwarfing the $4.6 billion dollar investment our nation makes to understand and treat eating disorders. If I were an economist, I might try to explain how the difference between investment and costs represents a margin, but I’m not. Instead, I want to focus on how these deaths occur in the margins of our health care system and the steps needed to prevent these fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report includes a case study of Hannah and demonstrates the need for better health care coverage for eating disorders. When Hannah was 13-years old, she developed anorexia, lost a third of her body weight and developed a serious heart problem that required hospitalization. After approximately six months of inpatient treatment, she was discharged and experienced a relapse that required intensive outpatient care. This was not covered by her parents’ insurance. Her mother estimated spending $10,000 in a single month to keep her daughter alive. Hannah is now recovered and advocates for better insurance coverage for eating disorder treatment, particularly for military families, like her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story does not represent an isolated case. Two weeks after the report was released, the following crossed my Twitter feed: “Friend diagnosed with AN (female in midlife). Kaiser wrongfully denying her authorization to a higher LOC [level of care]. Although she’s suffered for many years, she is not treatment resistant, as Kaiser claims. Resting heart rate is 35.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A resting heart rate of 35 beats per minute meets &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/medical-care-standards&quot;&gt;criteria&lt;/a&gt; for hospitalization. Low heart rate signifies that the body is shutting down. Denying medical care to an eating disorder patient in medical crisis is wrong. But it happens too often in a health care system that interprets parity for mental health as only applying to brain-based disorders. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/nine-truths&quot;&gt;myth&lt;/a&gt; that people choose to have an eating disorder is as misguided as the idea that someone would choose to have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and advocates have made huge efforts to increase recognition that eating disorders are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.20589&quot;&gt;biologically-based disorders&lt;/a&gt;, with genetic make-up contributing as much to their development as it does to the development of schizophrenia or asthma. If this stops a single person from being denied treatment to save their lives, good. But I’m still waiting for any explanation for why the cause of an eating disorder has anything to do with whether or not we should try to save a person’s life. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the leading cause of death in anorexia nervosa was suicide. If treatment prevents a person from taking her life, that saved life is easily worth the investment. It makes no difference whether the prevented death would have been caused by self-poisoning, self-starvation, or self-induced vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need more money in research funding to find better treatments, preventions, and cures for eating disorders. In 2019, the single largest funder of research, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, invested roughly $8/person with an eating disorder compared to $60,831/person with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/tbcases.htm&quot;&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;. The gap between funding for mental health and almost any other domain of health is well-known. But beyond that gap, eating disorders are marginalized within the field of mental health, receiving $8/person compared to $33/person for &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1267/2020/07/Social-Economic-Cost-of-Eating-Disorders-in-US.pdf&quot;&gt;$69/person for schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; research in 2019. This funding gap contributes to the gaping difference between &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.fda.gov/consumers/free-publications-women/depression-medicines&quot;&gt;28 FDA-approved medications for depression&lt;/a&gt; versus 0 for anorexia. Without greater funding to produce better treatments, we won’t see better outcomes. And the best time intervene is at the first sign of a problem. Catching any disease in its earliest stages produces the best outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need universal screening to promote early identification and intervention before the eating disorder progresses to a critical stage. While eating disorders lurk in the margins of awareness, we won’t see who is affected, we won’t see how they are affected, and we won’t know the full cost we pay for our ignorance. In the absence of universal screening, we will never know the true number of people killed by their eating disorder. No pathologist will ever “see” the eating disorder in a post-mortem exam, no matter how obvious the signs may be. In that same &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; where we found that suicide was the leading cause of death, we found that an eating disorder was never listed as the cause of death on the death certificate. Instead, we saw causes such as heart and liver failure in a 39-year-old woman who weighed less than half what a woman her age and height should weigh – less than half. In the absence of universal screening, we lose our best opportunity to prevent those deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to recognize eating disorders as serious mental illnesses that pose a threat to the health of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need better health care coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need more funding for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need universal screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Daan Stevens via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/yGUuMIqjIrU&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-the-healthcare-system-is-failing-people-with-eating-disorders/&quot;&gt;How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633090054/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A common goal for educators is to identify, and then teach, cognitive skills that are needed for the workplace. In 2017 a group of investigators at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X19890600&quot;&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; which skills are needed as a result of the rapid changes occurring as the United States shifted from an industrial to an information-based economy. The organization analyzed 142,000 online job advertisements that were posted between February and April of that year. The most highly requested skills were oral communication (28%), written communication (23%), collaboration (22%), and problem solving (19%). The Educational Testing Service decided to label them “21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century skills.” These skills are a combination of cognitive (nonroutine problem solving, critical thinking, metacognition), interpersonal (social), and intrapersonal (emotional, self-regulation) talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Economic Forum’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;Future of Jobs Report 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; took a different approach by asking executives of some of the world’s largest employers to report on the latest employment, skills, and human investment trends across their industries. The survey revealed an accelerating demand for new specialist roles related to understanding and using the latest emerging technologies – AI and machine learning specialists, big data specialists, process automation experts, information security analysts, human-machine interaction designers, and robotics engineers. Skills such as creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving will, according to the report, become more valuable. The World Economic Forum predicted that there will also be more demand for leadership, emotional intelligence, and social influence skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cognitive skills should be incorporated within courses taught at high schools, community colleges, and universities. An introduction to technological skills can begin in high school. In 2016, the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program oversaw the largest course launch in the program’s 60-year history with the release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles&quot;&gt;AP Computer Science Principles&lt;/a&gt;. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of the field and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. In the 2018-19 school year more than 5,000 schools were offering the course. A second course, AP Computer Science A, focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The course teaches the foundational concepts of computer science to encourage broader participation. Its big ideas are creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the internet, and global impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2019/participation-csp-nearly-doubles&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 100,000 students took the AP Computer Science Principles Exam in 2019, more than double the participation since the course launched during 2016-17 school year. During that period the number of female students, the number of Black/African American students, and the number of Hispanic/Latino students more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A challenge for community colleges and universities is to design instruction for the increasing number of students who enter higher education without a declared major. A 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www-chronicle-com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/article/How-Some-Colleges-Are-Helping/246913/?key=HngGmpmDh1Ozp8Ik-2G6XFI1SVT7LuhTKYD-bCGURaIwoJii8aqjFMQgzE4V6mzHbS1aVXR1NU9Xdmc4dEd5T0ZOVERfejRzVkRPVWx1NnV3OVBnOS1wdXVJQQ#.Xw8uKR9LEa0.gmail&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; discussed how some institutions are preventing these students from wandering among courses. One solution is to ask incoming students to select an academic focus area or meta-major to help them explore topics that should appeal to them. In the fall of 2019, the entire University System of Georgia asked incoming freshmen to declare an academic focus area if unable to select a major. The University of Houston has a similar program based on the same concept.  These programs have been influenced by studies that find college students have trouble succeeding because they are faced with an overwhelming number of options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community colleges are evaluating a related project. The Association of American Colleges and Universities &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/aacu-announces-twenty-institutions-new-guided-pathways-project&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it had selected 20 colleges to participate in a two-year evaluation project. The goals of the project are to map students’ goals to pathways, help students choose and enter a program pathway, keep students on the path, and ensure that students are learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A guided approach can also be helpful for reducing changes in majors. Within three years of their initial enrollment &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018434.pdf&quot;&gt;approximately 30%&lt;/a&gt; of undergraduates in associate and bachelor’s degree programs change their major at least once. But Georgia State University reduced changes in a major by 30 percent since it began its meta-majors program seven years ago. Those students who did change majors were more likely to have crossover credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although clustering courses around a meta-major may be helpful for students with undeclared majors, the courses do not necessarily teach skills that are important for the future workplace. These skills include oral communication, written communication, collaboration, and problem solving. They also include creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving. These cognitive skills should be incorporated within cluster courses to prepare freshmen for skills that are likely to be in demand when they graduate. The creation of generic courses for all majors should also focus on these skills because they are relevant to all college graduates. Such generic courses have the advantage that they do not require students to select a major or even a cluster area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/businesswoman-skills-ability-can-3641630/&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by Gerd Altmann via Pixabay&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-to-prepare-students-for-jobs-in-the-21st-century/&quot;&gt;How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632979100/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/its-cheaper-to-preserve-the-amazon-than-we-might-think/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It’s cheaper to preserve the Amazon than we might think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

The functionality of the simulator has been greatly expanded by the addition of a number of features that enable and simplify the creation, tuning, and simulation of complex networks with spatial structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;1.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The world is designed for —  and by — extraverts, forcing introverts to try and adapt to society&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/introverts-are-excluded-unfairly-in-an-extraverts-world&quot;&gt;writes Noa Herz&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;. But it’s unfair to place the onus on introverts, Herz argues, writing that simple changes could make work and educational settings more welcoming places for a group that makes up around a third of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40026&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness can manifest differently according to your age group, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/people-experience-loneliness-differently-depending-on-their-age/&quot;&gt;reports Amy Barrett&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers looking at data from thousands of adults in the Netherlands found that factors like living alone and psychological distress were associated with loneliness across all ages. But there were other factors that seemed more related to loneliness at particular times in people’s lives: for instance, younger people showed the greatest association between contact with friends and loneliness, while older adults showed an association between health and loneliness. The work suggests interventions need to be tailored to age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do children think of adults? &lt;/strong&gt;A new paper explores the beliefs kids have about their caregivers’ own thoughts, behaviours, and failings. The project was unique, in that it was led and designed by the kids themselves. At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, (adult) co-authors &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/children-reveal-what-they-really-think-of-adults-in-their-own-research-paper-144025&quot;&gt;Emma Maynard and Sarah Barton explain the work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewing abstract art actually makes us think with a more abstract mindset&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/abstract-art-mindset-study&quot;&gt;reports Emma Betuel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Inverse&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers had participants view abstract or realistic paintings, then asked them to act as art critics deciding when and where to display the art. Abstract paintings tended to be displayed further away in both time and physical distance, demonstrating the way abstract art evokes “psychological distance”, making us think more conceptually and less in terms of concrete details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children who have experienced violence or trauma show signs of faster aging&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/aug/03/children-who-suffer-violence-or-trauma-age-faster-study-finds&quot;&gt;reports Nicola Davis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. An analysis of dozens of studies found that these experiences tended to be related to earlier puberty in girls, as well as greater cellular aging and thinning of certain brain areas. However, the effects were small and more work is needed to understand the nature of the relationship, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, some pigeon psychology: scientists have found that attaching weights to the smaller birds results in them becoming more aggressive and rising up the social pecking order. &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers are not entirely sure why, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/08/05/899438701/attaching-small-weights-to-pigeons-helps-them-shoot-up-in-the-social-hierarchy?utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=science&quot;&gt;report Ari Shapiro and Stacey Vanek Smith&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;: the weights may have helped the pigeons feel in “better shape”, or the birds may have ended up hunting food more aggressively, as they needed to consume more calories. Either way, it matters because scientists routinely attach tracking devices to birds which give them extra weight.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many people have already written about the difficulties we’re having in the midst of COVID-19 – they are numerous and far-reaching, some as insidious as the disease itself. As researchers and clinicians in the field of eating disorders, we are now challenged to consider how we can best help those who are quarantined with a loved one experiencing symptoms of an eating problem. But for the family of a young person with an eating disorder, there are some specific concerns worth addressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, families need to make sure underweight teens are eating enough.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Family meals, in which support is provided by the household, are a mainstay of &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26092743/&quot;&gt;Family Based Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X%2814%2900686-7/fulltext&quot;&gt;treatment approach of choice&lt;/a&gt; for many teens in need of weight restoration. In this therapy, parents take charge of meal planning, preparation, and supervision, until they can hand responsibility back to the teen. While this typically represents a big change from normal for teens, during these unusual pandemic times, families are eating more meals together than ever before. This may help make the process just a little easier. Because intake needs tend to be high to achieve renourishment, it is important for parents to have a stock of calorically dense foods in the pantry or fridge. To counteract the rigidity and stereotyped eating behavior characteristic of restrictive-type disorders, it’s critical to frequently include challenging foods. Parents can talk with their children about what is most helpful during mealtimes – maybe it’s cheerleading with encouragement or reminding them how important to their goals in sports or in school eating well and getting better is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families should also minimize the risk of binge eating.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Parents may wonder, “if we are in the house so much now, should we get rid of foods that will tempt my teen to overdo it?” The truth is that binge eating is less about the food being eaten during the loss-of-control moment than it is a reflection of someone’s overall eating pattern, or a reaction to stressors (like feeling sad or anxious, or fighting with a friend or sibling) or circumstance (such as eating while watching Netflix or having constant, easy access to the kitchen). For these reasons, it’s more helpful to promote sticking with a pattern of eating regular meals and snacks, with a balance of nutritious, tasty foods. Parents can model non-eating-related coping strategies when feeling stressed, such as taking a walk, listening to upbeat music, or talking about it with someone. Parents can also initiate an activity and encourage a teen to join if it’s clear that he or she is having a hard time. Portioning food from large bags or serving containers in advance, having snack-size items on hand, and encouraging eating to happen at a table (rather than on the sofa) can also help minimize the chance of mindless overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is important to be aware of body image concerns.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The pandemic lifestyle may  lead to people feeling worse about how they look, exacerbating a negative body image. For example, it’s more tempting to dress down when socially distancing, and there may be fewer opportunities to get out and be active depending on the summer heat and humidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that the amount of time spent on social media, especially in curating an online persona or posting selfies, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23453676/&quot;&gt;negatively associated with body image, and disordered eating attitudes and behaviors&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, some people with eating disorders describe difficulty inhibiting self-scrutiny as they are repeatedly confronted with their image while on Zoom or FaceTime. Parents should talk with their teenagers to determine if they’d like to work treating the experiences on social media or video chat platforms like exposures, leaning into the discomfort, or if they’d prefer to adjust video settings to minimize their image until they are ready to take on an exposure mindset. It’s also important to look for occasions for all family members to dress up to encourage variety in clothing choices. Unconditional body positivity need not be the goal – for most of us, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://thefeedblog.com/2020/02/05/body-image-good-bad-and-in-between/&quot;&gt;body neutral is the place to aim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how much to talk about the eating disorder is a common problem for parents supporting children through recovery. And given the restrictions placed on us currently, parents might be noticing a lot and feel tempted to point out every concern. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important to flag troublesome, observable behaviors, and to clearly communicate expectations around particular goals – be it completing a meal, varying exercise routines, or trying a new food. However, these conversations are sometimes best had at a calm moment outside of mealtime. And it is equally important to continue to talk to teens about other topics – for example, popular shows, the latest goings on in a friend group, or reactions to current events in the world. Part of moving beyond an eating problem is developing and investing in other aspects of identity; this can be cultivated in conversation that reminds a teen subtly that a parent knows that the teenage is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;their eating disorder. He or she is so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coping with the COVID pandemic is challenging for all of us on many levels. This is equally or more true for parents of a youngster with an eating disorder. Although the basic strategies for helping do not change, there may be new opportunities to implement them and new situations to grapple with. And it is possible that increased time together as a family may yield some surprising benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-with-daughter-cafe_3586578.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by prostooleh via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/&quot;&gt;Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632789194/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/coping-with-covid-deaths-and-what-cinema-tells-us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coping with COVID deaths and what cinema tells us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-the-healthcare-system-is-failing-people-with-eating-disorders/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Picture4-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seventh BMC Ecology Image Competition received a number of stunning collections of photographs from ecologists around the world,  demonstrating their talents in presenting their research, using photography to highlight their work. Anyone affiliated with a research institute was able to enter and we were amazed by both the quality and variety of submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, our &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; Section Editors lent their expertise to judge the many entrants to the competition, selecting the best images from their area of research as well as the overall winner. Our accompanying editorial gives more information about the winning images, the stories behind them and why they were picked. This also includes a selection of 7 highly commended images; there are some really great photos so please do take a look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are our winning images:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall winner:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12056&quot; style=&quot;width: 582px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12056&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Sick-2-300x193.jpg&quot; width=&quot;572&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: David Costantini&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our overall winning image was taken by David Costantini from the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France. Viruses are a significant ecological concern because they are responsible for a variety of pathological effects in wildlife. This photograph is of a magnificent frigatebird (&lt;em&gt;Fregata magnificens&lt;/em&gt;) chick, suffering from a viral infection from which, unfortunately,  it isn’t likely to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner up:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12057&quot; style=&quot;width: 592px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12057&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Forest-green-lizard-2-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;582&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: S S Suresh.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our runner up, in sharp contrast to our overall winner, is an image showcasing the vibrant colors of a forest green lizard (&lt;em&gt;Calotes calotes&lt;/em&gt;). Dr S S Suresh from the Ibri Regional Referral Hospital in Oman captured this stunning photograph after spotting a pair of the iguanian lizards in their breeding plumage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral and Physiological Ecology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12058&quot; style=&quot;width: 457px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12058&quot; height=&quot;671&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/zombie-fungus-2-200x300.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;447&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: Damien Esquerré&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our winner in this category, taken by Damien Esquerré from the Australian National University, is entitled “Zombie fungus” and with good reason. The unfortunate weevil shown has been infected by Cordyceps, a fungus that infects insects, controls their behavior and then kills them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community, population and macro-ecology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12059&quot; style=&quot;width: 555px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12059&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/ghost-crab-2-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: HaoYun Zhuang&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This delightful winning image was captured  by HaoYun Zhuang from Fuzhou University. This is a ghost crab, hiding in a human footprint on a beach in China. These animals are usually pale in color, blending into the sand, and can move very quickly to escape from predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conservation Ecology and Biodiversity Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12060&quot; style=&quot;width: 573px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12060&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Forest-Pattern-2-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: Zu-Chang Xu&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our winner in this category was an entry by Zu-Chang Xu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  It demonstrates a phenomenon called “crown shyness”, whereby the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, resulting in a canopy with channel-like gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;line-height: normal; background: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landscape Ecology and Ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kang Xu, who is  from the College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University  is our winner in this category, submitting a stunning image of a wind farm in China’s Gobi Desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editors pick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12062&quot; style=&quot;width: 576px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12062&quot; height=&quot;428&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/the-kings-bath-2-300x227.jpg&quot; width=&quot;566&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: Nayden Chakarov&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice as the Editor is entitled “The Kings Bath” and it was captured by Nayden Chakarov from Bielefeld University, Germany. It’s a cheerful photo of a duck having a wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fostering a positive identification with science is an important part of many programmes trying to make STEM more diverse. This is vital, as underrepresented groups may be faced with cultural stereotypes about science: that scientists are &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/16/kids-are-more-motivated-to-do-science-than-be-a-scientist-a-finding-that-could-help-address-the-professions-diversity-problem/&quot;&gt;mainly White men&lt;/a&gt;, for example. These kinds of experiences can reinforce inequalities: &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/777458/Attitudes_towards_STEM_subjects_by_gender_at_KS4.pdf&quot;&gt;governmental research&lt;/a&gt; from 2019, for example, found that girls were far less likely to see themselves as good at science-related subjects, and enjoyed them less — despite outperforming their male peers at exams. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying as a ‘”science person” might also help other groups currently underrepresented in STEM. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167220936480&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin &lt;/em&gt;suggests that a strong scientific identity can foster belonging and help first-generation and Black and minority ethnic university students feel more at home in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40021&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Susie Chen from the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues first looked at whether science identification was predictive of academic performance. On the night before an exam, 368 students enrolled in an Introductory Biology course were emailed a survey asking how much they agreed with statements including “I am a science person”. The team also looked at participants’ course grade and general academic history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results confirmed that those who identified more as a science person achieved higher grades. But the impact of science identification was greater for minority (Black and minority ethnic and first generation) students: the grade difference between students with a low and high science identification was larger in that group than among White, continuing-generation students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at whether science identification was related to better grades because it fostered students’ sense of belonging. At the start of the term, a teacher asked students in the Introductory Biology course to form groups of three to five people based on some similarity, such as living in the same halls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the belonging condition then wrote for ten minutes about difficulties they were experiencing in the transition from school to university, and were given three quotes from other students addressing the same concerns and reminding participants that initial difficulties tend to be temporary and not an obstacle to belonging at university. Teams then discussed similarities and differences between their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the control condition, students took part in regular ice-breaking activities including drawing a mascot and choosing a biology-themed team name. Finally, science identification and belonging were both measured again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, science identification was more predictive of course outcomes for minority students than majority students. But the belonging manipulation had an effect too. Course outcomes for minority students in the social belonging condition were no longer dependent on science identification. This suggests that science ID does in fact invoke a sense of belonging that helps students perform well in class, and that other ways of fostering that sense of belonging can buffer against the negative effects of having a low science identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the intervention work? The authors suggest it’s because minority students may suffer from a lack of belonging due to stereotypes about what a scientist looks like: they might feel they don’t fit that profile. For example, previous research has found that minority groups are &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/&quot;&gt;more likely to experience imposter syndrome&lt;/a&gt; — and that that can have a negative impact on levels of achievement, engagement, attendance and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many reasons minority students might not feel like they belong, including institutional racism or other discrimination, so looking more closely at &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; students don’t feel they fit in or identify with their chosen topic could be helpful in developing more robust solutions. Future research could also look at intersectionality — how different backgrounds or identities work together to influence sense of belonging, science identification or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167220936480&quot;&gt;Am I a Science Person? A Strong Science Identity Bolsters Minority Students’ Sense of Belonging and Performance in College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/person-409127_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness across life phases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During adulthood, roughly from 18 to 65 years, we pass through several life phases, with every life phase having specific behaviors and goals that are normative for that phase. Being in your twenties or early thirties, for instance, means that you might have to have an active, blossoming social life and be preparing for your dream job. Moreover, during your mid-thirties and your forties, you might be trying hard to balance your career, the upbringing of your children and the care for aging parents. After reaching the age of 50, the importance of and focus on your career might decrease, while the time with your loved ones will become more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness. One could expect that if the behaviors and goals differ per life phase, the factors associated with loneliness might follow the same pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore whether the factors associated with loneliness change as people age, we used data from a large regional health survey, the Adult Health Monitor. Participants of this survey were asked about their subjective feelings of loneliness, demographic factors, social and health-related factors. Differences between three groups, young adults (19-34), early middle-aged adults (35-49) and late middle-aged adults (50-65), were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with what we expected, we found that some of the factors associated with loneliness differ for the various life phases. Firstly, for young adults a stronger association between frequency of contact with friends and lower levels of loneliness was observed, compared to early and late middle-aged adults. This is exactly what was expected as, in your twenties, friends are some of the most important people in your life. Secondly, having a job was associated with lower levels of loneliness only for early middle-aged adults, which links to the career ambitions people might have at this age. For late middle-aged adults, those who were married experienced lower levels of loneliness. Again, we expected to find this, considering that emotional closeness increases with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, our study has demonstrated that some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress. Remarkably, most of these factors are indicators for psychological health. This seems to demonstrate that psychological problems are associated with loneliness, no matter what age you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, psychological health may be threatened. And on top of that, COVID-19 impacts adults differently according to the important factors of their life phase as well. For example, young adults are not able to interact with their friends or classmates face to face anymore. Early middle-aged adults have to work from home, while supervising their children and worrying about their aging parents, whereas for late middle-aged adults visiting their loved ones has become impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whatever age you are, the risk of loneliness is always there, lurking in the background. And maybe now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best way to deal with loneliness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the factors associated with loneliness change when people age, then what are the implications for combatting loneliness? Currently, most interventions have limited effects and are largely universal and focused on all adults, without making distinctions between young adults and late middle-aged adults. The results of our study suggest that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness, but that approaches tailored to age and life phase might be advisable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/08/06/factors-associated-with-perceived-loneliness-across-the-adult-life-span/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Factors associated with perceived loneliness across the adult life span&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BMC Series blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to see ourselves as better than our peers across a whole range of traits and skills. We think we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/23/most-of-us-think-were-more-environmentally-friendly-than-our-peers/&quot;&gt;more environmentally friendly&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/&quot;&gt;morally superior&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/25/introducing-the-invisibility-cloak-illusion-we-think-were-more-observant-and-less-observed-than-everyone-else/&quot;&gt;more observant&lt;/a&gt; than those around us. The bias can even spill over to our perceptions of our loved ones: we &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/&quot;&gt;overestimate the intelligence of our romantic partners&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-29806-001&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Psychology and Aging &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;there’s one domain where we don’t see ourselves as “better than average”: remembering other people’s names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40015&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past work has shown that the better-than-average effect is less likely to occur for tasks that are particularly challenging. Given that older adults experience more memory difficulties, perhaps they would be less likely to believe that their memory abilities are better-than-average than younger people, reasoned the researchers, led by Mary Hargis at Texas Christian University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see whether this was the case, the team asked 84 participants aged 20-25 and 69 participants aged 60-84 to rate their own abilities and traits compared to others of the same age. Participants were asked about their ability to remember names, scientific terms, historical figures, and locations, as well as their perceptions of their own honesty, leadership ability, ability to get along with others, and capacity for hard work. For each of these skills and traits, participants rated themselves on a scale from 1 (much worse than others of the same age) to 9 (much better than others of the same age); a score of 5 indicated they thought they were average for their age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also rated how they believed someone would feel if they were to forget that person’s name — and how &lt;em&gt;they &lt;/em&gt;would feel if someone else forgot their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that the older adults rated themselves as significantly above average on all of the memory skills and traits — except for their ability to remember names. Younger participants also tended to rate themselves as above average, except for name memory, and memory for history and locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that both younger and older adults failed to show a better-than-average effect suggests that the pattern of results can’t simply be attributed to memory difficulties that come with age.  Instead, we may come to believe that our name memory is no better than that of our peers because errors involving forgetting people’s names are particularly salient and embarrassing: most of us can probably recall an awkward exchange where we forgot someone’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlighting just how excruciating that experience can be, participants generally indicated that forgetting someone else’s name would be a more negative experience than someone forgetting their name.  In fact, for older adults at least, those who showed greater embarrassment at forgetting someone else’s name, compared to having their own name forgotten, tended to rate their name memory as worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear why younger adults also failed to show a better-than-average effect for history and location memory, though the authors speculate that a similar process could be at work: perhaps failures of these kinds of memory are more prominent for younger people (if they did poorly in a history exam, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the usual caveats apply here: the sample size was pretty small and in this case limited to just younger and older adults, so the study can’t say much about how other age groups might view their memory abilities. Plus, statistically speaking, failing to find a significant effect is not quite the same as proving that there is no effect. So it will be interesting to see whether these effects (or lack thereof) are replicated in further work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the study raises the intriguing possibility that we may have a more realistic view of our skills when our failures have negative social consequences. “Perhaps if we perceive our memory errors to occur while others are paying attention … we create a more accurate representation of our memory’s fallibility and are less likely to be overconfident in our abilities,” the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-29806-001&quot;&gt;Remembering proper names as a potential exception to the better-than-average effect in younger and older adults.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/08/05/leveraging-machine-learning-to-fuel-new-discoveries-with-the-arxiv-dataset/"/>
		<id>https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=658</id>
		<updated>2020-08-05T13:30:47+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;For nearly 30 years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; has served the public and research communities by providing open access to scholarly articles, from the vast branches of physics to the many subdisciplines of computer science to everything in between, including math, statistics, electrical engineering, quantitative biology, and economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of arXiv research papers is both beneficial and challenging. Whether it’s a graduate student ramping up in her respective field, an established professor delving into adjacent ones, or researchers searching for big picture insights for the public good, this rich corpus of information offers significant, but sometimes overwhelming, depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help make the arXiv more accessible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv&quot;&gt;we present a free, open pipeline on Kaggle to the machine-readable arXiv dataset: a repository of 1.7 million articles&lt;/a&gt;, with relevant features such as article titles, authors, categories, abstracts, full text PDFs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having the entire arXiv corpus on Kaggle grows the potential of arXiv articles immensely,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “By offering the dataset on Kaggle we go beyond what humans can learn by reading all these articles and we make the data and information behind arXiv available to the public in a machine-readable format.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaggle is a destination for data scientists and machine learning engineers seeking interesting datasets, public notebooks, and competitions. Researchers can utilize Kaggle’s extensive data exploration tools and easily share their relevant scripts and output with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“arXiv is more than a repository of articles, it’s a platform for knowledge sharing,” said Presani. “This requires constant innovation on how we present and interpret the knowledge we make available. Kaggle users can help push the limits of this innovation and it can be a new outlet for our community to collaborate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With large data sets, there is generally an expectation that there are likely to be overlooked discoveries, connections, innovative tools or perspectives, which may lead to additional insights, not just in the original subject, but across other fields of study, enabling yet more discovery and innovation,” said Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Call to Action&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope is to empower new use cases that can lead to the exploration of richer machine learning techniques that combine multi-modal features towards applications like trend analysis, paper recommender engines, category prediction, co-citation networks, knowledge graph construction, and semantic search interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of such a semantic search application built on top of a specific corpus would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/an-nlu-powered-tool-to-explore-covid-19.html&quot;&gt;Google’s COVID-19 Research Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that helps researchers pore through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge&quot;&gt;CORD-19 dataset&lt;/a&gt; – a repository of 190,000+ science articles on COVID-19. Interfaces built on datasets such as this leverage advanced NLU techniques to understand a user’s &lt;i&gt;intent&lt;/i&gt; behind a query. Ultimately, this can enable more efficient research by surfacing relevant data and evidence to complex, scientific questions. We hope the release of the machine-readable arXiv dataset will inspire the creation of similar NLU tools over this new corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Alemi, Senior Research Scientist at Google, has also pursued more exciting applications of ML using the arXiv. As described in the paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00075.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Use of arXiv as a Dataset&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , Alex and his colleagues sought to propel the arXiv as a benchmark for large scale, multi-relational tasks, such as with graph neural networks.  “I’m excited to see the research community rise to the challenge of a rich, multifaceted dataset with so much real-world practicality, and the new questions this will raise,” says Alex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv&quot;&gt;The dataset is now available on Kaggle&lt;/a&gt; and will be updated weekly. Please send us your feedback and stay tuned for additional updates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Paul Ginsparg, the noted physicist and visionary behind the arXiv, and Jack Hidary of X, The Moonshot Factory, who worked to bring this collaboration to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dataset would not be possible without the helpful input of many people. Much appreciation to (in alphabetical order of last name): Alex Alemi, Timo Bozsolik, Alison Fromme, Peijen Lin, Brian Maltzan, Eleonora Presani, Steinn Sigurdsson and Joe Tricot.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What is the responsibility of psychologists to their clients and their communities during times of crisis? Annually, the American Psychological Association meets to present the research and best practices to meet the needs of the profession and the broader world.  These nine new titles present the latest, most advanced research to create a bridge between the academy and practitioners as we work to address racism and hate, face the psychological toll of COVID-19, and strive for sustainable leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-tough-standard-9780190075873&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tough Standard: The Hard Truths About Masculinity and Violence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Ronald F. Levant and Shana Pryor &lt;/strong&gt;Written by past president of American Psychological Association, this book &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;ynthesizes over four decades of research in the psychology of men and the role of masculine norms in the present moment in American including the Me Too movement, March for Our Lives, and Black Lives Matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-9780190056742&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legacy of Racism for Children: Psychology, Law, and Public Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;edited by Margaret C. Stevenson, Bette L. Bottoms, and Kelly C. Burke &lt;/strong&gt;This volume is the first book to examine issues that arise when minority children’s lives are influenced by laws and policies that are rooted in historical racism. It addresses intersections of race/ethnicity within the context of child maltreatment, custody and interracial adoption, familial incarceration, school punishment and the school-to-prison pipeline, juvenile justice, police/youth interactions, jurors’ perceptions of child and adolescent victims and defendants, and immigration law and policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-science-of-diversity-9780190686345&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Science of Diversity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Mona Sue Weissmark &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESmIEa-jJrY-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This book uses a multidisciplinary approach to excavate the&lt;br /&gt;theories, principles, and paradigms that illuminate our understanding of the issues surrounding human diversity, social equality, and justice.

The book grapples with a host of provocative questions, from why we are so afraid of zombies, to whether dyslexia is just in our heads, from what happens to us when we die, to why we are so infatuated with our brains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/innumeracy-in-the-wild-9780190861094&quot;&gt;Innumeracy in the Wild: Misunderstanding and Misusing Numbers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;by Ellen Peters &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EY-FC0t9ABw-146x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;146&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This book&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;presents the logic, rules, and habits that highly numerate people use in decision making. This text offers a state-of-the-art review of the now sizeable body of psychological and applied findings that demonstrate the critical importance of numeracy in our world. With more than two decades of experience in the decision sciences, Ellen Peters demonstrates how intervention can foster adult numeric capacity, propel people to use numeric facts in decision making, and empower people with lower numeracy to reason better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/leading-with-feeling-9780190698942&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leading with Feeling: Nine Strategies of Emotionally Intelligent Leadership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Cary Cherniss &lt;/strong&gt;This book describes how 25 outstanding leaders used emotional intelligence to deal with critical challenges and opportunities. Featuring commentary from the leaders themselves, the book distills their experiences into nine strategies that can help anyone be more effective at work. Each chapter features activities designed to help readers apply the strategies to their own working lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/reset-9780197532638&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reset: An Introduction to Behavior&lt;/em&gt; Centered Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Robert Aunger&lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EY-FC1H9uig-146x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;146&quot; /&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;This book presents Behavior Centered Design, a new framework for how to change behavior and implement processes for developing change programs. Drawing on cutting-edge research in evolutionary biology, ecological psychology, and neuroscience, this  approach encourages practitioners to think differently about behavior – both in understanding how and why it is produced, and in how to design programs to change it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These books—from leaders in academia and in the practice field—continue the critical dialog of how the field of psychology can respond proactively and adaptively to the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@sylviasyang?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Sylvia Yang&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/books?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/nine-titles-on-the-frontiers-of-psychology-research-reading-list/&quot;&gt;Nine titles on the frontiers of psychology research [reading list]&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632719274/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632719274/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f07%2fESmIEa-jJrY-145x220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/nine-titles-for-psychologists-in-a-time-of-crisis-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nine titles for psychologists in a time of crisis [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-communities-can-help-stop-covid-19/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How communities can help stop COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/___ellie&quot;&gt;Ellie Broughton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that Black people are particularly like to be victims of “anger bias”, in which others incorrectly interpret their facial expressions as angry. Past studies have focused on adult faces — but now evidence shows that even young kids face such prejudice. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Femo0000756&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; has found that teacher trainees more often misperceive primary-school-age Black children as being angry.&lt;span id=&quot;more-40007&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Amy Halberstadt at North Carolina State University, asked 178 prospective teachers from training programmes in the southeastern United States to complete an emotion recognition task. The participants saw video clips of 72 children, aged 9 to 13, making facial expressions depicting six emotions (happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprised, or disgusted). The kids were divided equally by race (Black, White) and gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trainees were asked to supply their best judgment about the emotion depicted in each face. In the first set of trials they just saw the very beginning of an emotional expression, but later saw a more fully created expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then assessed trainees’ implicit bias via the child race Implicit Association Test (IAT), and explicit bias via a questionnaire (REACT) which asked participants to rate their agreement with prejudiced statements about how race affects student behaviour, such as “Black students don’t study very much”. (Although the IAT has &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/&quot;&gt;previously been criticised&lt;/a&gt; as a measure of “implicit” attitudes, the main findings of the new study don’t rely on this measure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers had fair accuracy at detecting emotions, but in both White and Black children, boys were more often misread as looking angry when showing other facial expressions. (The sample of teachers, which reflects typical trends in the profession, was 89% female).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, Black boys were misperceived as angry more often than White boys, and Black girls were more often misperceived as angry than White girls. Surprisingly, higher levels of bias (implicit or explicit) did not actually increase the likelihood that Black children would face anger bias, but instead decreased the likelihood that teachers would misperceive White children to be angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors hypothesise that for the trainees, understanding children’s emotions “may intersect with the racial biases teachers have acquired through living in a culture in which racial stereotypes are well-embedded”, leading them to mistake Black children as angry when they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could have two significant consequences, they write. Misperceived anger that leads to a teacher punishing a child can disrupt their education, while anger is also “emotionally contagious” so could lead to a teacher becoming angry themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research adds to some other studies which have also found evidence of racial biases in teachers. A previous US study, for example, found that in an early years classroom &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/zigler/publications/Preschool%20Implicit%20Bias%20Policy%20Brief_final_9_26_276766_5379_v1.pdf&quot;&gt;teachers gazed longer at Black children&lt;/a&gt;, especially Black boys, while looking for “challenging behaviors”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halberstadt says she hopes this research will ultimately help to develop better interventions to combat racialised biases. “Racialised bias is known to every Black family in the United States. When I talk with colleagues and friends, groups and families, people nod their heads: ‘Yes, we know this. What’s new?’” This study was designed to demonstrate the existence of this bias to White people and other researchers, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s also keen to expose other racial prejudices besides the anger bias: “We want to keep our eyes and ears open to what other phenomena are being imposed by … culture and by White people on others because of stereotypes. So the next question is, ‘ What are other biases that we have that we haven’t become aware of?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, researchers from the Centre For Education and Youth (CFEY) &lt;a href=&quot;https://cfey.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LKMco-and-GLA-Boys-on-Track-FINAL-version-for-web.pdf&quot;&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that teachers in London show biases against Black Caribbean boys and White boys from poorer backgrounds. This affected not just disciplinary measures at school (for example, they were more likely to be expelled), but also assessment, such as which academic ability stream students were put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellie Mulcahy, head of research at CFEY, says the findings of Halberstadt’s study are very concerning: “While this is a US study, and more research is sorely needed in the UK context, we know that racial bias is a problem in the UK.” Currently, we have no idea how early in their education Black children in UK nurseries and schools encounter bias from teachers. Isn’t it time to find out?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/lgbt-4115612_640-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging is a major risk factor for the majority of chronic diseases, which include diseases like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and arthritis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04188.x&quot;&gt;More than half&lt;/a&gt; of older adults in the US have &lt;em&gt;three or more&lt;/em&gt; chronic diseases. Having multiple chronic diseases can increase the chances for disability, hospitalization, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults are an under-served population that experience health disparities often related to a lifetime of stressors such as stigma, discrimination, and oppression. As such, this is a population with many barriers to receiving patient-centered health care. With aging, middle-aged and older LGB adults are therefore likely to be at risk not only for medical diseases, but also other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that gay men and bisexual women in particular, were at high risk for having two or more conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine chronic diseases in this population, we used data from the US &lt;a href=&quot;https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm&quot;&gt;National Survey of Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt; to determine the extent of three chronic conditions: mental illness, unhealthy substance use, and having two or more medical diseases. We then looked at the presence of having more than one of these conditions among LGB adults age 50 and older. We found that gay men and bisexual women in particular, were at high risk for having two or more conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results highlight the complex health needs of this population. It is important to recognize that while medical and public health interventions usually focus on one condition, this is often not appropriate for older adults with multiple chronic diseases. A patient-centered coordinated approach is needed that considers how each condition is interrelated with other coexisting diseases. Unhealthy substance use and mental illness for example can complicate the management of chronic medical diseases and lead to poorer health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The care of older adults, especially for communities that are under-served, such as sexual minority populations, needs to involve patient-centered care that considers all chronic diseases and how they may be related. For older LGB adults we also need a greater awareness of all possible forms of stigma related to people such as older individuals and those of sexual minority status, and we must understand how this may impact health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of our research is to not further stigmatize but to draw attention to the needs of older adults from communities who have been neglected and under-served so that they can receive better care through improved awareness of the multiple factors that affect health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/03/overconfidence-can-be-transmitted-from-person-to-person/"/>
		<id>http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40004</id>
		<updated>2020-08-03T12:54:39+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be some people within a group who are more confident than others. But some groups as a whole tend towards modesty — as with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kung-San-Women-Foraging-Society/dp/0521295610&quot;&gt;!Kung hunters of the Kalahari Desert&lt;/a&gt;, for example, who deliberately downplay their own achievements and efforts. However, the opposite can also occur — and widespread overconfidence can of course become a problem, as with the US energy company Enron, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076790902726665?journalCode=fbsh20&quot;&gt;“culture of arrogance”&lt;/a&gt; ultimately led to its downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two examples are highlighted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45451-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, which reveals a route by which a bias towards overconfidence can develop. In their paper, Joey T Cheng at York University and colleagues first propose and then provide evidence for the idea that if we’re exposed to people who are overconfident, this rubs off on us. In other words, we calibrate our self-assessments based on the confidence level of those around us. Overconfidence can, then, be transmitted socially — and this could help to explain how groups, teams and organisations form their own, sometimes drastically different, confidence norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40004&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team ran a series of six studies to explore all this. In the first study, involving 104 participants, pairs of previously unacquainted students were put to work, first individually and then together, on a lab task. The task involved guessing the personality traits of 10 people from photographs. After completing the task both times, each participant ranked themselves according to how well they’d thought they’d done, relative to everyone else in the group. The team found that working with someone who’d over-ranked their own performance rubbed off on the other member of the pair — after the joint task, they became more confident in their own ability. (This happened though neither member knew what the other’s self-ranking had been.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers write, “after working together, initially non-similar strangers became more similar to each other in terms of over-placement, suggesting the convergence of over-confidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsequent five studies explored this effect further experimentally. A study that involved asking participants to guess the weights of people from photographs revealed that overconfidence (or in this study, at least, reduced under-confidence) can be transmitted indirectly, from person to person to person, “highlighting the extensive reach of confident peers”. (In this study, participants were indirectly influenced by a fictitious former partner of their own partner in the weight-guessing task.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further work revealed that these confidence effects can persist, still being evident several days later. Importantly, two of the studies produced evidence that the influence of overconfident peers on a participant’s own self-estimations happened largely outside their conscious awareness. As the team writes, if you’re unaware of such a “stealthy” transmission of bias, this could make it harder to resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work also reveals one important qualifier to all these effects: overconfidence transmission occurs only within &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;-groups. In this case, student participants were influenced by the responses of “partners” who were identified as attending the same university, but not by responses from people identified as coming from a rival university sports team, for example. “That is, individuals do not copy indiscriminately”, the team writes. “Instead they are sensitive to whose mental representations are on display and selectively acquire the over-placement of in-group but not out-group members.” This is consistent with theories about cultural learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the researchers themselves point out, these studies focused on over-placement as one form of overconfidence. More work will be needed to investigate whether this kind of social transmission occurs for other forms, such as over-estimation, which relates strictly to your stand-alone performance — the belief that you did better than you actually did in a test, for example. Similarly, it’s not yet clear whether it applies to over-precision (being&lt;em&gt; convinced&lt;/em&gt; that you scored at least 80 per cent, for example, when you didn’t.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the work does contribute to our understanding of how an atmosphere of overconfidence (in the form of over-placement, at least) develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory doesn’t negate the possibility that there are also cultural effects relevant to overestimation. For example, the researchers write, in the US, the most individualistic society in the world, unusually high levels of overconfidence might be triggered by cultural cues that emphasise success and self-sufficiency — and as those cultural values spread between people, so too can over-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the work still suggests that overconfident beliefs among a few may lead to a cascade-like spread of biased beliefs through a social group, team, or society. A recognition that this happens, will surely be important for all kinds of organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45451-001&quot;&gt;The social transmission of overconfidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2020-08-03T10:51:43+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/cure-1006810_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the 1920s, there have been over 150 antibacterial drugs developed and marketed for human or veterinary use. The effect these drugs have had on infectious diseases and population health is remarkable. A once considered serious bacterial infection can now be successfully managed using antibiotics prescribed from the doctor. This was not always the case, as our grandparents may testify: bacterial infections were often fatal and the choices available to manage such infections were limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have been urged to reduce the amount of antibiotics they prescribe when it is safe and appropriate to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “golden age” of discovery may, however, soon come to an end, as more and more bacteria are becoming resistant to the antibiotics available to us. It is for this reason that healthcare organizations across the world have been focusing on developing stewardship policies to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics. In England, the situation is no different, and the Department of Health and Social Care have developed an antimicrobial resistance strategy. As part of the plan, doctors have been urged to reduce the amount of antibiotics they prescribe when it is safe and appropriate to do so. As the majority of antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care, healthcare providers working in this setting are set specific prescribing targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to establish if the polices are working from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, but also that these polices are fair, and do not penalize communities in the most need of care. Our work aimed to address these questions. To do this, we used antibiotic prescribing data from the NHS, as well as working out the characteristics of the local areas in England using nationally available data sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, the plan to reduce antibiotic prescribing appears to be working&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we found that, in England, the plan to reduce antibiotic prescribing appears to be working: since 2014, antibiotic prescribing has reduced by around 14 per cent.  We also found that prescribing of certain classes of antibiotics, namely those considered broad spectrum, have also reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we considered local factors in our analysis, we showed that the most deprived areas of England had the highest levels of antibiotic prescribing.  When we adjusted for two long-term conditions – diabetes and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease – both of which are associated with increased antibiotic use, we still found higher levels of antibiotic prescribing in the most deprived areas of England.  We also showed that geography was an important factor too: compared to London, all other areas of England had higher levels of antibiotic prescribing – with the East of England, and the North East of England having the highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering local needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might ask why this is important? Well, that’s a good question.  Our work shows that in addition to a national strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing, it is important to consider local needs too. People living in more deprived areas might, for example, might have greater health need for antibiotics compared to people living in more affluent areas.  National one-sized-fits all targets might not necessarily account for this. If there is greater antibiotic need in deprived areas, doctors working in these areas might be unfairly penalized for prescribing them.  This is not fair on the doctors working in primary care, but may also impact on patients too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibiotic stewardship polices appear to be reducing overall antibiotic prescribing, which is a positive thing, although there is still significant variation in prescribing across England.  It would be appropriate for future prescribing targets to account for local factors to ensure the most deprived communities are not inappropriately penalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is if someone is in medical need of an antibiotic, they should be prescribed it, regardless of the characteristics of their local area or where they live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have reported on the unusual case study of a man, known as RFS, who could read letters but not numbers.&lt;/strong&gt; When RFS saw numbers, they appeared as a jumbled up mess, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/mysterious-case-man-who-can-read-letters-not-numbers-exposes-complex-roots&quot;&gt;writes Sam Kean&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Yet he could see the shape of an “8” once it was turned on its side, suggesting that the problem wasn’t a visual deficit, but something specific to number processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40000&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study has found sex differences in the volume of grey matter in certain areas of the brain — differences which may be related to the expression of genes on sex chromosomes. &lt;/strong&gt;But the work brings up age-old questions about sex difference research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/a-study-finds-sex-differences-in-the-brain-does-it-matter/&quot;&gt;explains Grace Huckins&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;. Do these kinds of differences have any actual real-world consequences?  And how do you prevent results from being misinterpreted or used to justify sexism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new theory suggests that we dream so that our visual cortex continues to receive input and doesn’t suffer from a lack of stimulation.&lt;/strong&gt; However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/a-new-theory-of-dreaming&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic isn’t convinced&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A massive study on more than 11,000 couples has found that the key to a happy relationship may be the characteristics of the relationship itself, rather than of each individual partner.&lt;/strong&gt; “Relationship-based variables” — things like conflict, feelings of appreciation and sexual satisfaction — accounted for a larger chunk of participants’ relationship satisfaction than their own personalities or traits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/dating-study-predicts-happy-relationships&quot;&gt;writes Emma Betuel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Inverse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication strategies during the coronavirus crisis haven’t always considered people’s cognitive biases. &lt;/strong&gt;There are lessons to be learned from these failures that could help to improve messaging on climate change, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-shows-how-to-get-people-to-act-on-climate-change-heres-the-psychology-143300&quot;&gt;argue Geoff Beattie and Laura McGuire&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The crisis has been hard for all of us, but health workers have been placed in a particularly stressful situation&lt;/strong&gt;. And preliminary evidence suggests that these workers may be at risk of developing mental health problems like PTSD and anxiety, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coronavirus-ptsd-doctors-nurses-mental-health&quot;&gt;writes Sabrina Weiss&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could lockdown also produce a lasting change to our personalities?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not implausible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200728-how-lockdown-may-have-changed-your-personality&quot;&gt;writes Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;: we know that personality traits are not set in stone, but can change throughout our lives. However, it’s too early to say exactly how our personalities might have changed — and any effects will likely be different for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Rapid testing has been a powerful tool to control COVID-19 outbreaks around the world (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://content.iospress.com/articles/clinical-hemorheology-and-microcirculation/ch209004&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, …). While many countries support testing through government sponsored healthcare infrastructure, in the United States COVID-19 testing has largely been organized and provided by for-profit businesses. While financial incentives coupled with social commitment have motivated many scientists and engineers at companies and universities to work hard around the clock to facilitate testing, there are also many individuals who have succumbed to greed. Opportunism has bubbled to the surface and scams, swindles, rackets, misdirection and fraud abound. This is happening at a time when workplaces are in desperate need of testing, and demands for testing are likely to increase as schools, colleges and universities start opening up in the next month. Here are some examples of what is going on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First and foremost there is your basic fraud. In July, a company called “Fillakit”, which had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus-contracts/contracts/70FB7020D00000029&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;awarded a $10.5 million federal contract&lt;/a&gt; to make COVID-19 test kits, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/fema-ordered-10-2-million-in-covid-19-testing-kits-its-now-warning-states-not-to-use&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shipping unusable, contaminated, soda bottles&lt;/a&gt;. This “business”, started by some law and real estate guy called &lt;a href=&quot;https://kiowacountypress.net/content/closer-look-federal-covid-contractors-reveals-inexperience-fraud-accusations-and-weapons&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paul Wexler, who has been repeatedly accused of fraud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-test-kit-maker-dissolves-amid-probes-11594153304&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went under two months after it launched&lt;/a&gt; amidst a slew of investigations and complaints from former workers. Oh, BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87789&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michigan ordered 322,000 Fillakit tubes&lt;/a&gt; which went straight to the trash (as a result they could not do a week worth of tests).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all fraud is large scale. Some former VP at now defunct “Cure Cannabis Solutions” ordered 100 COVID-19 test kits that do who-knows-what at a price of 50c a kit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/feds-seize-100-fraudulent-covid-19-test-kits-shipped-from-china-addressed-to-portland-man-with-prior-ties-to-cannabis-industry.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Feds seized it&lt;/a&gt;. These kits, which were not FDA approved, were sourced from “Anhui DeepBlue Medical” in Hefei, China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be fair, the Cannabis guy was small fry. In Laredo Texas, some guy called Robert Castañeda received assistance from a &lt;em&gt;congressman&lt;/em&gt; to purchase $500,000 of kits from the same place! Anhui DeepBlue Medical sent Castańeda 20,000 kits ($25 a test). Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/he-spent--500-000-to-buy-coronavirus-tests-health-officials-say-theyre-unreliable&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the tests had 20% accuracy.&lt;/a&gt; To his credit, the Cannabis guy paid 1/50th the price for this junk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s not forget who is really raking in the bucks though. Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp are the primary testing outfits in the US right now; each is processing around 150,000 tests a day. These are for-profit companies and indeed they are making a profit. The economics is simple: insurance companies reimburse LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics for the tests. The rates are basically determined by the amount that Medicare will pay, i.e. the government price point. Intiially, the reimbursement was set at $51, and well… at that price LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/30/coronavirus-testing-stunted-low-medicare-reimbursement/3048943001/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weren’t that interested&lt;/a&gt;. I mean, people have to put food on the table, right? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=205179230701958&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adam Schechter&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of LabCorp makes $4.9 million a year; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=241018100270891&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Steve Rusckowski&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Quest Diagnostics, makes $9.9 million a year). So the Medicare reimbursement rate was raised to $100. The thing is, LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics get paid regardless of how long it takes to return test results. &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc7.com/coronavirus-los-angeles-california-testing-long-wait-for-covid-19/6341394/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Some people are currently waiting 15 days to get results&lt;/a&gt; (narrator: such tests results are useless).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps a silver lining lies in the stock price of these companies. The title of this post is “$ How to Profit From COVID-19 Testing $”. I guess being able to take a week or two to return a test result and still get paid $100 for something that cost $30 lifts the stock price… and you can profit!&lt;img alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.03.23 AM&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-14474 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14474&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.03.23 AM&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2496,1326&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2-03-23-am/&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=490&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s not forget the tech bros! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-utahs-tech-industry-tried-to-disrupt-coronavirus-testing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A bunch of dudes in Utah from companies like Nomi, Domo and Qualtrics signed a two-month contract with the state of Utah to provide 3,000 tests a day&lt;/a&gt;. One of the tech executives pushing the initiative, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.testutah.com/en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TestUtah&lt;/a&gt;, was a 37-year old founder (of Nomi Health) by the name of Mark Newman. He admitted that “none of us knew anything about lab testing at the start of the effort”. Didn’t stop Newman et al. from signing more than $50 million in agreements with several states to provide testing. tl;dr: the tests had a poor limit of detection, samples were mishandled, throughput was much lower than promised etc. etc. and as a result they weren’t finding positive cases at rates similar to other testing facilities. The significance is summarized poignantly in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-utahs-tech-industry-tried-to-disrupt-coronavirus-testing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New Yorker piece about the debacle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I might be sick, but I want to go see my grandma, who’s ninety-five. So I go to a TestUtah site, and I get tested. TestUtah tells me I’m negative. I go see grandma, and she gets sick from me because my result was wrong, because TestUtah ran an unvalidated test.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. There has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/24/utah-adds/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a disturbing TestUtah hydroxycholorquine story going on behind the scenes&lt;/a&gt;. I include this fact because no post on fraud and COVID-19 would be complete without a mention of hydroxycholoroquine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe though, the tech bros will save the day. The recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://xprize.org/prizes/covidtesting&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$5 million COVID-19 X-prize&lt;/a&gt; is supposed to incentivize the development of “Frequent. Fast. Cheap. Easy.” COVID-19 testing. The goal is nothing less than to “radically change the world.” I’m hopeful, but I just hope they don’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/10-million-genomics-x-prize-canceled-outpaced-innovation-8C10990757&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cancel it like they did the genome prize&lt;/a&gt;. After all, their goal of “500 tests per week with 12 hour turnaround from sample to result” is likely to be outpaced by innovation just like what happened with genome sequencing. So in terms of making money from COVID-19 testing don’t hold your breath with this prize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As is evident from the examples above, one of the obstacles to quick riches with COVID-19 testing in the USA is the FDA. The thing about COVID-19 testing is that lying to the FDA on applications, or providing unauthorized tests, can lead to unpleasantries, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jail&lt;/a&gt;. So some play it straight and narrow. Consider, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://seqonce.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SeqOnce&lt;/a&gt;, which has developed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://seqonce.com/azureseq/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Azureseq SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit&lt;/a&gt;. These guys have an “EUA-FDA validated test”: &lt;img alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.14.45 AM&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-14476&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14476&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.14.45 AM&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2336,2130&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2-14-45-am/&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=490&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is exactly what you want! You can click on “Order Now” and pay $3,000 for a kit that can be used to test several hundred samples (great price!) and the site has all the necessary information: IFUs (these are “instructions for use” that come with FDA authorized tests), validation results etc. If you look carefully you’ll see that administration of the test requires FDA approval. The company is upfront about this. Except the test is not FDA authorized; this is easy to confirm by examining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the FDA Coronavirus EUA site&lt;/a&gt;. One can infer from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://seqonce.com/seqonce-biosciences-launches-azureseq-one-step-universal-sars-cov-2-rt-qpcr-kit/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that they have &lt;em&gt;submitted&lt;/em&gt; an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) but while they claim it has been &lt;em&gt;validated&lt;/em&gt;, nowhere does it say it has been &lt;em&gt;authorized.&lt;/em&gt;Clever eh? &lt;em&gt;Authorized,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;validated, authorized, validated, authorized, .. &lt;/em&gt;and here I was just about to spend $3,000 for a bunch of tests that cannot be currently legally administered. &lt;strong&gt;Whew&lt;/strong&gt;!At least this is not fraud. Maybe it’s better called… I don’t know… a game? Other companies are playing similar games. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.concentricbyginkgo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gingko Bioworks is advertising “testing at scale, supporting schools and businesses” with an “Easy to use FDA-authorized test”&lt;/a&gt; but again this seems to be a product that has “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-06-19/ginkgo-bioworks-ceo-on-new-covid-19-testing-initiative-video&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt;“, not one that, you know, actually exists; I could find no Gingko Bioworks test that works at scale that is authorized on the FDA Coronavirus EUA website, and it turns out that what they mean by FDA authorized is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jrkelly/status/1273704377665101838?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an RT-PCR test that they have outsourced to others&lt;/a&gt;.  Fingers crossed though- maybe the marketing helped CEO Jason Kelly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/28/business/ginkgo-raises-70-million-ramp-up-covid-19-testing-employers-universities/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raise the $70 million&lt;/a&gt; his company has received for the effort; I certainly hope it works (soon)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the way, I mentioned that the SeqOnce operation is a bunch of “guys”. I meant this literally; this is their “team”:&lt;br /&gt;

Just one sec… &lt;strong&gt;what is up with biotech startups and 100% men leadership teams? &lt;/strong&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epinomics.co/team-bios&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Epinomics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insightgenetics.com/about/management-team&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Insight Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceangenomics.com/team/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ocean Genomics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kailosgenetics.com/our-team&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kailos Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://circulogene.com/leadership-team/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Circulogene&lt;/a&gt;, etc. etc.)… And what’s up with the black and white thing? Is that to try to hide that there are no people of color?&lt;br /&gt;
I mention the 100% male team because if you look at all the people mentioned in this post, all of them are guys (except the person in the next sentence), and I didn’t plan that, it just how it worked out. Look, I’m not casting shade on the former CEO of Theranos. I’m just saying that there is a strong correlation here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, back to the regular programming…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of swindlers and scammers, this post would not be complete without a mention of the COVID-19 testing czar, Jared Kushner. His secret testing plan for the United States went “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;poof into thin air&lt;/a&gt;“! I felt that the 1 million contaminated and unusable Chinese test kits that he ordered for &lt;em&gt;$52 million&lt;/em&gt; deserved the final mention in this post. Sadly, these failed kits appear to be the main thrust of the federal response to COVID-19 testing needs so far, and consistent with Trump’s recent call to, “slow the testing down” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/politics/donald-trump-testing-slow-down-response/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he wasn’t kidding&lt;/a&gt;). Let’s see what turns up today at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/110912?s=1&amp;amp;r=50&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hearings of the U.S. House Select Subcommittee on Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, whose agenda is “The Urgent Need for a National Plan to Contain the Coronavirus”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

When first introduced, the attraction of the Big Deal was immediately obvious, since it allows a library to buy its faculty access to most, if not all, of a publisher’s journals at a much lower “cost per article” (discounted) rate. From the start, however, there were doubters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SQq3Yrs6Dvw/XyKcsrJBXfI/AAAAAAAAq6k/G4_Q9KLe-SwD1cURP6VLy-7am7li4aduQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1024/ShannonPritting.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;683&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SQq3Yrs6Dvw/XyKcsrJBXfI/AAAAAAAAq6k/G4_Q9KLe-SwD1cURP6VLy-7am7li4aduQCNcBGAsYHQ/w256-h170/ShannonPritting.jpg&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Shannon Pritting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2001, the Director of Libraries at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Kenneth Frazier, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march01/frazier/03frazier.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; the library community of the dangers of signing big deals, or any comprehensive licensing agreement, with commercial publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The current generation of library directors is engaged in a dangerous ‘game’ in which short-term institutional benefits are achieved at the long-term expense of the academic community,” he warned, adding that big deals would weaken libraries’ ability to manage their journal collections, foist on them journals they “neither need nor want” and increase their dependence on publishers “who have already shown their determination to monopolize the information marketplace.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nevertheless, many libraries did sign big deals. And many later regretted it, not least because, having done so, they felt they had no choice but to keep renewing the contract, even as the cost kept going up and devoured more and more of their budget. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Libraries felt trapped, conscious that if they did not renew they would have to go back to subscribing to individual journals at list price, which would mean being able to afford access to fewer journals, and fearful that when they discovered that journals they wanted were no longer available, faculty would revolt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over time, however, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/05/01/wolf-finally-arrives-big-deal-cancelations-north-american-libraries/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;greater willingness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to think the unthinkable emerged, and some libraries began to cancel their big deals. And when they did so the sky did not fall in – which allowed other libraries to take heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The list maintained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brXHnANwLBCHYo5b79hF6vGF63fdOCSOSiPxCScf0hc/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests that libraries began cancelling their big deals as long ago as 2008, but the number doing so has been accelerating in the last few years. What has really focussed minds are the recent decisions by both the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00758-x&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;University of California&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611#.XuJLLWKW_k0.twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to walk away from their negotiations with Elsevier rather than renew their big deals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it is not necessary to walk away completely in the way UC and MIT have done. Instead, libraries can “unbundle” their Big Deal by replacing the large package of several thousand journals they are subscribed to with a small à la carte bundle of a few hundred journals, and in the process save themselves a great deal of money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is helping libraries to make the decision to unbundle is the knowledge that more and more research is becoming available on an open access basis. In addition, new tools like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsub.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;Unsub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; are available to advise them on which journals they can cancel without too great an impact, and which journals are essential and so should be retained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the big savings that can be realised, and the pressure library budgets are under, unbundling is expected to grow, particularly in light of the straitened circumstances that libraries will find themselves in after &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;This year a number of US universities have unbundled in favour of smaller packages of journals, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.unc.edu/2020/04/upcoming-elsevier-cancellations/&quot;&gt;UNC Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-original-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;data-original-href&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.lib.iastate.edu/elsevier&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default&quot;&gt;Iowa State University&lt;/a&gt; and the State University of New York (&lt;a data-original-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;data-original-href&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://slcny.libguides.com/slc/elsevier2020update&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default&quot;&gt;SUNY&lt;/a&gt;) -- a system of 64 institutions. Coming in the wake of UC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; decision to walk away from Elsevier these &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;little deals&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; have attracted a lot of attention. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Europe, by contrast, there is a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/&quot;&gt;greater focus&lt;/a&gt; right no on signing &lt;a data-original-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;data-original-href&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/04/23/transformative-agreements/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default&quot;&gt;transformative agreements&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to providing reading rights, these new-style big deals include prepaid publishing rights to allow faculty to publish their articles on an open access basis. Amongst other things, these deals help assuage concerns about &lt;a data-original-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;data-original-href&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.rluk.ac.uk/the-costs-of-double-dipping/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default&quot;&gt;double dipping&lt;/a&gt; (where a university may end up paying both article-processing charges and subscriptions for the same journals). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;So how is a decision to unbundle made, and what are the issues and implications of making the decision? To get a clearer picture I spoke recently by email with Shannon Pritting, Shared Library Services Platform Project Director at SUNY. In April, SUNY replaced its Big Deal of 2,200 journals with Elsevier with a “little deal” of just 248 journals. By doing so, it says, it has saved about $7 million.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unbundling raises a lot of questions, and I suspect we may not have answers to all of the questions for some time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, as more and more universities unbundle, how accurate will the calculations informing the decisions about which journals to give up and which to keep prove to be over time? This could have implications for, amongst other things, how much of the money that has been saved will need to be spent on obtaining paywalled articles through Interlibrary Loan (ILL) and document delivery services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moreover, since unbundling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brXHnANwLBCHYo5b79hF6vGF63fdOCSOSiPxCScf0hc/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; currently to be mainly a US thing (with Europe favouring transformative agreements) might we see a geographical divide emerge? If we do, what might the implications of this be, especially for the open access movement?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, might unbundling encourage more researchers to use illegal services like Sci-Hub, and might unbundling see university libraries marginalised to some extent, especially if they do not play an active role in funding open access?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please read on for the interview. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoBodyText&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;The interview begins …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: SUNY consists of 64 campuses I believe. Do they all publish research papers, or is it primarily the 4 main campuses?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; SUNY consists of 60 campuses. The additional 4 are Cornell Statutory colleges, which don’t rely on SUNY for services such as library access. The majority of publishing comes from the 4 University Centers, but there are many other faculty who publish research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY has doctoral granting colleges with scholars who produce research in specialized areas, and it has 13 University Colleges with graduate programs and faculty who have publishing and research expectations for promotion and tenure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How many papers a year in total does SUNY publish?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to data gathered through Dimensions, over the past five years (2015-2019), SUNY faculty and staff have published on average 9,960 papers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over this term, publishing is split virtually evenly between Open Access and Subscription Based publishing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You referred to 4 University Centers. I am thinking that these are Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, and Stony Brook. You also referred to 4 Cornell Statutory colleges and said they do not rely on SUNY for services like library access. So the number of published papers you cite does not include all of the campuses?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 4 University Centers (Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, and Stony Brook) are included in the numbers of papers affiliated with SUNY authors. These 4 university centers participate fully with SUNY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But, there are 4 Cornell Statutory colleges that rely on Cornell for library and other support. These are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suny.edu/attend/visit-us/complete-campus-list/cornell-als/#:~:text=NYS%20College%20of%20Agriculture%20%26%20Life%20Sciences%20at%20Cornell%20University&amp;amp;text=It%20is%20the%20only%20college,the%20nation%2C%20and%20the%20world.&quot;&gt;NYS College of Agriculture &amp;amp; Life Sciences at Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.human.cornell.edu/&quot;&gt;NYS College of Human Ecology at Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/&quot;&gt;NYS School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vet.cornell.edu/&quot;&gt;NYS College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These statutory colleges are not included in the number of papers published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How many of the open access papers you refer to are published as gold OA and how many as hybrid OA?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;And how do you expect these figures to change in the next few years? Also, how much do SUNY libraries pay each year in gold OA fees?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;For 2019, there were 1,035 SUNY papers published as gold OA, with 461 being published as hybrid. Over the five-year period from 2015-2019, SUNY authors published on average 1,361 gold open access articles and 565 hybrid open access articles per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;No SUNY libraries currently pay for OA fees. These costs are paid directly by the author or the department, and payment data is not centrally managed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We expect that OA fees paid by SUNY authors will remain relatively stable, as most agencies who provide grant funding have already implemented OA requirements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: SUNY does not therefore know how much is spent on APCs each year by SUNY faculty?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;No, SUNY does not have a reliable estimate of how much is spent on APCs by SUNY faculty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is there a SUNY-wide OA policy, or does each campus have its own separate policy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; There is a system wide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://system.suny.edu/academic-affairs/open-access/&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;open access policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, approved by the SUNY Board of Trustees in March 2018. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This policy requires that the Universities (but not community colleges) should develop and adopt open access policies for each institution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The community colleges are encouraged, but not required, to adopt open access policies. Of the 30 universities, 21 currently have open access policies, with all 30 expected to have policies by December 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three community colleges have open access policies, with the expectation that only a few more will develop open access policies. We have collected institutional open access policies into a repository that you can view &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/handle/1951/71081&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the most part, SUNY institutional OA policies leave the decision of whether to publish open access or deposit works into repositories with the faculty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A major focus of SUNY in open access has been through Open Educational Resources (OER), which has led to major improvements in college affordability, and improvements in teaching and learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The investment in OER came from NY State Government, with $12 million invested in OER over three years, that has resulted in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suny.edu/suny-news/press-releases/02-20/2-4-20/2-4-20-oer-savings.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;nearly $50 million in savings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and improved teaching and learning outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Unbundling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: SUNY recently unbundled its Big Deal with Elsevier, reducing the number of journals it subscribes to from 2,200 to 248. As I understand it from a recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/tool-saving-universities-millions-dollars-journal-subscriptions&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, SUNY used Unsub to help it decide which journals to give up, and this estimated that a modest number of subscriptions would be enough to supplement the large numbers of Elsevier papers already available outside of paywalls. Of the papers SUNY researchers can access under the new arrangement, the calculation was that 30% of the papers that faculty are likely to need access to are available open access and, thanks to a post-termination agreement (PTA) with Elsevier, 25% will remain freely available to faculty from Elsevier. This does not imply that 45% will need to be ordered via document delivery services right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY partnered with Unsub (at the time Unpaywall Journals) to model costs and access options if we decided to cancel or unbundle our Elsevier Big Deal. The percentage you mention of 45% of content not being immediately accessible isn’t something that the Unsub data generally provided as a data point. Although the Unsub data varied by journal, the percentage that wouldn’t be immediately accessible was typically below 20%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although there was a lot of scepticism about the reliability of Unsub data and modelling in predicting costs post-cancellation, the tool and services helped us to think critically about all other data we were using to determine value. In the end, most SUNYs found that Unsub data was useful, and as reliable as other sources that we were using to determine the value of a big deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, Post-Termination Access helps with providing immediate access. However, I don’t think that any campus expects that either 45% or 20% of the usage would translate into document delivery purchases. Everyone understands that journal usage data is inflated, flawed, and doesn’t reflect true usage and value. Yet, most forecasts of costs after cancellation or unbundling are based on vendor provided usage data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you provide any barrier such as requesting a purchase, ILL, or anything but directly downloading a PDF or HTML document, the percentage of users who will actually try to request is very small.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we expect minimal increase in document delivery costs as a result of changing the Big Deal to a smaller, focused package. And, if libraries find that users are requesting via ILL or document delivery a high amount of articles from any specific journal, they can always subscribe to a single journal if it’s cost effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall, the strategy was that the big deal provides access to a lot of content, but our big deal wasn’t an effective use of our money; it was worth it to see what actually happens after we changed our subscription.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And, I expect that we’ll see the same trends and results that other consortia and libraries have seen: a cancellation of a big deal doesn’t lead to resulting increased costs for article purchasing or ILL that is anywhere near what a subscription to that large set of journals costs. Most users will find alternative sources as the user usually doesn’t need a specific article, but just needs an article that is relevant to the topic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the end, SUNY’s decision was based on the simple equation of whether 2,200 journals was worth the amount we were paying for the Big Deal, and not the fear of what the costs would be for guaranteeing the same type of access to the 2,200 journals as we had when we subscribed to the bundle.  Just as important as determining whether we could provide access to papers we would lose from the bundled titles was determining how many of these 2,200 journals we needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This work took just as much time or more than cost modelling. It involved outreach by many librarians with faculty and administration across SUNY. SUNY also hosted several coordinated open forums with faculty about the Elsevier deal, and engaged with Faculty governance and administration at the system and campus levels. Certainly usage data informed the journals we targeted for the 248, but equally important was input from our user community that was led by librarians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We certainly had to walk through various data-driven scenarios of costs after cancellation, value of the package based on usage (and what journals were most important) to ensure we were gathering input and managing the change that comes from moving away from a Big Deal. But, the decision for SUNY was based on whether we valued the journals enough to pay the amount the vendor required us to pay to maintain that access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the end, it wasn’t in the best interests of SUNY to continue with the Big Deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Individual title subscriptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: As you indicate, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the Elsevier unbundled deal assumes that any campus or department that needs access to journals not in the smaller bundle can subscribe separately. Do you have any sense of how many such subscriptions might be taken out/have been taken out? Presumably, they would need to be funded with money outside the library budget.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The expectation is that campuses who want to subscribe to journals outside of the 248 titles that most of SUNY gets is that the library subscribes to the journal separately at list price. This funding would be coming from the individual library budget, and would be funded with savings from the difference between what the library would have contributed to the previous big deal and the smaller 248 title deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There have been very few individual title subscriptions for Elsevier titles that were lost in the change to the smaller unbundled deal. The global pandemic began to impact the US just after the new unbundled deal was finalized, which resulted in libraries immediately beginning to limit spending, and then begin to cut budgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The savings from the change from the Big Deal to an unbundled deal provided campuses with the ability to weather drastic cuts, and many used the savings to help meet the need to quickly cut spending and budgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Presumably the figure of 25% of articles that will be freely available as a result of the PTA with Elsevier will grow over time, in line with the number of new papers published in Elsevier journals that are not covered by the PTA?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;There will be some growth in the percentage of content that our users may want, but don’t have immediate access to as our Post Termination access grows less current. However, the percent increase and the costs of access will not be enough of a percentage to come close to the difference in what our previous deal cost our institutions, and what our current subscription will cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY would prefer to look at the aggregate savings built by the years it will take for our PTA to age as a major advantage to unbundling. In essence, as the industry shifts and more consortia and large libraries break subscriptions, the market for journal access will only be more advantageous to the subscriber in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thinking of growth over time in the amount of content that our users can’t access via PTA, or a subscription, assumes that the value of a subscription or journal package will only grow. It’s clear that the value of big deals is declining, so future deals should only be more advantageous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If SUNY does find it more cost effective to enter into another big deal or “re-bundle” what it recently unbundled, future deals should be better than the deal we had, which was based on historical metrics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Of those papers that will be available open access how many do you estimate will be the Version of Record (VoR) and how many are likely to be self-archived versions – e.g. preprint, Authors Accepted Manuscript (AAM), or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/research/open-access/open-access-and-the-ref/understanding-versions-of-your-paper/%5d&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;some other version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; that is not the VoR? Does the version matter?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a tough question to answer, but based on experience searching for content and assisting users, I’d say that about half of the access would be content that is other than the Version of Record. In most cases, the Version of Record is not needed. But, when it is needed, this is where document delivery purchasing would be used.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;ILL and document delivery services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: So, SUNY uses both ILL and document delivery services for obtaining articles in journals it does not subscribe to. Can you say which services are used and how many documents on average are ordered each year via a) ILL and b) document delivery services? How do you expect those figures to change going forward?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our primary vendor for document delivery is Reprints Desk. A few institutions also use Copyright Clearance Center’s “Get it Now” service, but this is only for a small percentage of the document delivery volume. SUNY Libraries use the lowest cost vendor for document delivery, and for all but a few percent of articles, Reprints Desk is the lowest cost option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on 5 years of ILL data (2015-19) SUNY has 300,000 total ILL requests per year (both lending and borrowing) for books and articles. Considering that half of ILL requests are for articles, and half of the requests are lending, about 100,000 requests are for ILL articles per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over this five-year span, total ILL volume has decreased a few percent per year. I expect that the total volume of ILL will continue to decrease, especially for articles. Every consortium that has cancelled big deals has found that there has been little impact on overall ILL volume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the 100,000 articles requested in SUNY each year, about 25% are for content published within the last five years, which has the potential to incur costs for access. ILL departments are already doing a fine job providing access to current content as a supplement or alternative to subscriptions, and will be a reliable source to provide access for any content that is needed but not available via subscription.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY libraries have regularly found that providing access to journals via ILL and document delivery is more cost effective than subscribing to journals that have high subscription costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY doesn’t currently have data on how many document delivery purchases are made per year, but we are working with our primary document delivery provider to gather this data to use as another point of consideration when we consider access options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Do you have any sense of how much SUNY libraries generally pay for document delivery and ILL services each year?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The amount that SUNY pays for document delivery and ILL services each year varies between institutions. Typically, smaller institutions don’t pay for document delivery, with our largest few institutions paying from $50,000 to $100,000. But we don’t currently have reliable detailed data on this document delivery spending in aggregate across our 60 institutions as each campus pays separately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although our campuses will continue to decrease the amount of content such as journals that they license, we expect to see only a slight increase in document delivery costs. Users typically find alternative paths to journal articles if libraries don’t subscribe, whether it’s open access or alternative versions of a paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Document delivery is used only in limited circumstances, and we expect the percentage of articles that are available without a subscription to continue to increase. Most of the SUNYs also have enabled Unpaywall integration in their link resolvers, so open access is provided as an option whenever possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I understand it costs between $35 and $40 per article to order via Reprints Desk. In addition, there will be costs for ILL. An &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&amp;amp;context=library_facpubs&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; from 2015 estimates the cost of ILL at between $8-$10 per item. Does that sound about right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have reasonably reliable data about the number of transactions where campuses have paid copyright (which in this case includes purchasing the article from a document delivery provider) and the number is 16,250 per year. Your estimate of $35-$40 per article is fair, so our document delivery and copyright spending would be roughly $568,750 dollars per year. However, some of the heaviest requested publications such as Nature, and even Elsevier publications, cost less than $25 per article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We think that there is a fair amount of open access that gets purchased or requested via ILL, especially in hybrid journals. This is why we’re excited that Reprints Desk has an open access filter that some libraries are using. As you’re likely aware, finding open access in hybrid publications is often not easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using your estimate of $8-10 per article for ILL, which I find reasonable, you’re correct that the spending on ILL for articles ordered from other libraries via resource sharing would be around $670,000 per year.  SUNY continues to try to minimize this cost by assessing costs of resource sharing systems and networks to ensure that we’re getting our best value for the resource sharing we need to serve our users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we were using the Unsub post-cancellation cost modelling tool, they defaulted to $17 per request based on older estimates from ILL literature. Even with this higher ILL estimate, the model still indicated that most of our campuses should subscribe to only a small group of journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Ok, so as a rough estimate we can say that SUNY Libraries are receiving about 100,000 article requests a year from faculty. Of these about 16,250 will be supplied via document delivery services (at a cost of around $568,750) and some 83,750 will be supplied via ILL (at a cost of about $670,000). So the total cost of fulfilling individual article requests will be around $1.238 million a year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does SUNY operate a mediated document delivery service, or can faculty go online and order documents without the library needing to be involved?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some SUNY institutions provide an unmediated document delivery service, typically facilitated through an ILL workflow. However, most document delivery purchasing comes as a supplement to Interlibrary Loan requests, where libraries are purchasing articles rather than pay copyright royalties, lending fees, or to prevent slow service.  About half of the SUNY institutions are using a locally developed software middleware system called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1072303X.2017.1305034&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;Article Gateway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to facilitate unmediated document delivery through ILL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unmediated document delivery is always provided for a limited number of titles that are most cost effective to use via document delivery article access rather than subscriptions for the entire campus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of our campuses are small, but offer advanced degrees in specialized areas. As many STEM publishers use metrics that utilize types and level of programs for subscription rates, document delivery is an attractive option to provide access to resources as subscription costs are often beyond the ability of these small campuses to afford.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Illegal services and big deals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You say you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;expect minimal increase in document delivery costs as a result of changing from a big deal to a smaller deal because “Once you provide any barrier such as requesting a purchase, ILL, or anything but directly downloading a PDF or HTML document, the percentage of users who will actually try to request is very small.” Is there any concern that by unbundling the library could encourage users to access illegal services like Sci-Hub?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, SUNY values the work that publishers do, including Elsevier. SUNY wishes to continue its relationship with Elsevier moving forward, as we’ll continue for multiple years to have at least a group of 248 titles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, I think what unbundling does is focus the review not purely on cost per use, which inflates the value of a subscription. This point has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, the focus becomes more on the value of the usage you’re getting for the amount you’re paying, not purely letting usage drive the value discussion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By looking at link resolver data you can find that users often land on records of articles to which they have access, load the pdf into a browser, but never engage with the article. So, with content they do not have access to they may come to a record but never take the next step of ordering the article via ILL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We realize that the best case scenario for everyone would be that bundles of the highest quality content were available at prices that were slowly decreasing to acknowledge that the cost of IT infrastructure is going down, so journal hosting prices should go down. But, that’s not the offers that are typically coming from publishers. Library budgets, at least in SUNY, are declining, so increasing costs lead us to make tough decisions about which of the subscriptions to cut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The proposition that unbundling will lead to more use of illegal access and that this is a problem that the library or libraries should solve isn’t one that is fair to libraries. It’s not that libraries are seeking to offer less content to their users; they just can’t afford increasing prices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We hope that, instead of illegal services becoming more common open access and open science becomes more prevalent and shifts the readership models to open access rather than Sci-Hub or models that aren’t connected to legitimate organizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How many big deals does SUNY currently have and with whom?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; SUNY is not a consortium that has historically collaborated on big deals for content. This is partially due to the diversity of types of institutions, and partially due to capacity at the central office. The Elsevier Big Deal was the only major full-text deal SUNY had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY has historically had a large package of aggregator content labelled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sunyconnect.suny.edu/about.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;SUNYConnect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that all campuses subscribe to. However, beyond the Elsevier deal and SUNYConnect, there is currently very little content that the 60 institutions or large groups within the system coordinate purchasing on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY is working to do more coordinated collection activity, and will consider big deals if the offer is appropriate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, with most big deals, there is such a wide variety of content that we don’t anticipate finding many deals that will benefit enough of SUNY to pursue. The overall management overhead for big deals is also something we thought about in depth as we moved from the Elsevier big deal to an unbundled group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;With smaller unbundled coordinated collecting, the opportunity to change strategies or to cancel is less overwhelming, and outweighs the benefit of access to journals in bulk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Transformative agreements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Has SUNY signed any transformative agreements? If so, with whom? If not does it plan to?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; SUNY as a system, or as individual institutions, has not signed any transformative agreements. At this point, it seems unlikely that SUNY would enter into any large-scale transformative agreements in the near future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The culture and organizational structure of SUNY is such that individual authors have been paying open access fees. Although SUNY libraries are largely supportive of movements towards open such as open access and open educational resources, the financial implications of transformative agreements would be difficult for most SUNY libraries to justify.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY library budgets will continue to be negatively impacted, so the focus will likely be on getting the most relevant access over the next 3-5 years. However, SUNY will continue to ask for terms and discounts for publishing open access as much as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When a commitment to dedicate funds away from current access to supporting open access comes into play with negotiations, SUNY will likely continue to prioritize current access. An overlooked portion of the SUNY-Elsevier unbundled deal was a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/briefs/2020/04/suny-elsevier-deal.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;10% discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; on Elsevier APCs for SUNY Authors, which is typical of the approach we’ll likely be taking with other deals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we can include terms that are advantageous to authors moving towards open access, we’ll do so, but won’t sacrifice access or incur more costs to move from a read to read and publish strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You say that SUNY libraries are not responsible for paying any gold OA fees and that payment data is not centrally managed. Do you think there is a danger that by not being involved in the management of APCs, and by unbundling, SUNY libraries might be risking marginalising themselves to some extent? I note in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/ck8u3/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; the authors say, “Studies have shown that interlibrary loan often does not increase following journal cancellations, but rather than being good news, this may represent a decrease in perceived library value by researchers. Open Access will also play a critical and increasing role in this environment, and understanding its relation to the content at hand will be important in building a robust and sustainable research support system.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The paper also suggests that unbundling could, over the longer term, have a negative impact on smaller institutions that rely on their larger peers to supply ILL requests. I wonder also if, as we see more institutions breaking their Big Deals, the ILL system could start to come under pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do you have any thoughts on these matters?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a direct response to the quote about ILL volume not increasing after big deal cancellations representing a decrease in “perceived library value,” this statement indicates something that I’ve never fully understood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Libraries see it as their responsibility to figure ways to keep providing the same content, even if the deals get worse and cripple the organization further. Why wouldn’t libraries see this not as a referendum on the value of the library, but as an indicator of how much the exact content they were subscribing to mattered. I realize things are always complex in these situations, but libraries shouldn’t tie up their value with keeping specific subscriptions. Libraries offer so much more than just access to articles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regarding risking being marginalized if SUNY doesn’t focus on transformative agreements or continuing to find ways to subscribe to large journal packages: I agree that unbundling should signal a shift in how libraries focus on access. And, SUNY certainly isn’t against transformative agreements or subscribing to bundles of journals that make sense financially.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, focusing on licensing agreements with publishers as the main vehicle will likely lead to further issues in the future where libraries again cannot sustain the costs of the endeavours they’re focusing on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY will be focusing on ways we can help our system’s faculty and staff participate more in open access publishing to make their intellectual property and research more accessible to all.  We can be sure that publishers and vendors will be partners with us as we begin to move more into open access strategies. But, APCs and transformative agreements should be analysed in our overall context regarding increasing access for SUNY faculty, staff, and students and making the output of SUNY faculty, staff, and students more accessible to the larger community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, ILL and availability of articles is something to be aware of, especially if more large subscription reductions and unbundling continue. ILL departments have seen staffing reductions, which has led to a focus on streamlining workflows, and has brought about a decade’s worth of focus in ILL (at least in the US) that has seen most of the innovation going towards automation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What ILL has lacked is a large-scale investment in focusing on the larger ecosystem, which includes better terms in licensing and the ability to offer new services rather than just offering the same services more efficiently. But, I think there’s going to be a real shift in libraries moving more towards collections services, which includes ILL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, Princeton has adopted this model, which focuses on both access and collections. There needs to be better structural support for ILL, so that consortial coordination of collection and access for things like journals can happen. SUNY discussed all of this when we were considering unbundling, and although we focused for the past six months on showing libraries how to arrange and configure alternative access, we’re at a point now where we can focus on more structural issues that use multiple data points when making collection decisions or setting strategic directions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This spirit has been strong in SUNY with coordinated collection development via resource sharing and demand driven acquisitions for books for some time, with many libraries seeking to diversify SUNY’s collection if a title isn’t available in SUNY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re hoping that we can coordinate journal access in a similar way, where we have programs where SUNYs cooperate on what journals they subscribe to in order to provide the best access to e-journals for all of SUNY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, vendors will likely be offering more in the way of access options that allows consortia to blend ILL-like access and subscriptions. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coalliance.org/news/sillvr-pilot-streaming-video-resource-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;SILLVR project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for streaming video &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;at the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries is one such pilot where the larger consortium is looking to secure both subscriptions and access in a single license.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;With ILL and collections access departments blending, libraries should be prepared to look at licensing and subscriptions differently, and find the best blend of subscriptions and bundled access that will get the best value for their institutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

A massive educational industry has promoted the idea of distinct “learning styles” based on preference for one of these four modalities  (take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vark-learn.com/introduction-to-vark/the-vark-modalities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'Visual, Aural, Read/write, and Kinesthetic sensory modalities' test&quot;&gt;VARK&lt;/a&gt;!).

This should come as no surprise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446532/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; queried the occupational choices of self-selected populations of people at the extremes of visual imagery abilities: those with Aphantasia (n=993 male/981 female) or Hyperphantasia (n=65 male/132 female). This was assessed by their scores on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aphantasia.com/vividness-of-visual-imagery-questionnaire/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; (VVIQ). There was also a control group with average scores on the VVIQ, but they were poorly matched on age and education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kmv7eNrBI10/XyNDX5TXDJI/AAAAAAAANMM/3SlbJGT3ZNYaLEnA2h01RM42efKxgmqHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Aphantasia%252C%2BHyperphantasia%252C%2BOccupation.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;520&quot; data-original-width=&quot;935&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kmv7eNrBI10/XyNDX5TXDJI/AAAAAAAANMM/3SlbJGT3ZNYaLEnA2h01RM42efKxgmqHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Aphantasia%252C%2BHyperphantasia%252C%2BOccupation.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446532/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zeman et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/b&gt;Percentage of participants with aphantasia and hyperphantasia reporting their occupation as being:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; = Management, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; = Business and ﬁnancial; &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; = Computer and mathematical/Life, physical, social science; &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; = Education, training, and library; &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; = Arts, design, entertainment, sports and media; &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; = Healthcare, practitioners and technical. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, people with fantastic visual imagery were more likely to be in arts, design, entertainment, and media, as well as sports (an excellent ability to imagine a pole vault or swing a bat would be very helpful). People with poor to no visual imagery were more likely to choose a scientific or mathematical occupation. These categories are rather broad, however. For instance, “media” includes print media. And artists and photographers with Aphantasia certainly do exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The study had a number of limitations, e.g. washing out individual differences and relying on introspection for rating visual imagery ability (as noted by the authors). There are more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945217303581&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;binocular rivalry&quot;&gt;objective ways&lt;/a&gt; to test for imagery, but these involve in-person visits. Although the authors were circumspect in the Discussion, they were a bit splashy in the title of their paper (&lt;i&gt;Phantasia–The Psychological Significance Of Lifelong Visual Imagery Vivdness Extremes&lt;/i&gt;). And the condition of “Aphantasia”  existed &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Galton/imagery.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Galton (1880). 'Statistics of Mental Imagery'&quot;&gt;long before&lt;/a&gt; it was named and popularized. But these researchers have caught the imagination of the general public, so to speak:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The delineation of these forms of extreme imagery also clarifies a vital distinction between imagery and imagination: people with aphantasia–who include the geneticist Craig Venter, the neurologist Oliver Sacks and the creator of Firefox, Blake Ross–can be richly imaginative, as visualisation is only one element of this more complex capacity to represent, reshape and reconceive things in their absence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeman A, Milton F, Della Sala S, Dewar M, Frayling T, Gaddum J, Hattersley A, Heuerman-Williamson B, Jones K, MacKisack M, Winlove C.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the coronavirus hit, many of us had to quickly adapt to remote working — and even post-pandemic, many of us are likely to continue at least some of these tasks online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demands for more flexible working practices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/0087e432-9085-11ea-bc44-dbf6756c871a&quot;&gt;continue to grow&lt;/a&gt;, and for good reason — it can make life easier for employees with parenting or caring responsibilities, health problems or disabilities, and some argue it can also increase productivity. Online webinars and conferences also allow continued professional development without workers ever having to leave their home office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are no different in the world of education: many undergraduate courses now provide lecture recordings for students to watch in their own time, and online masters programmes are offered by some of the UK’s top universities. Freshers’ Week this year is also likely to be very different, with many students experiencing a wholly virtual first year of university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But learning online is not always easy. How do you concentrate when staring at a screen for hours at a time? How do you manage your workload? And what is the best strategy for note-taking? Here’s our digest of the findings that could help to make online learning stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39996&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn how to make notes effectively&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing down what’s said during lectures may seem fairly straightforward. But there is evidence that some strategies are better than others — and knowing what those are could help you take notes more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, a team from Kent State University &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/04/what-do-todays-students-get-right-and-wrong-in-how-they-take-lecture-notes/&quot;&gt;looked at how often students were following best practice&lt;/a&gt; on note-taking. Writing with pen and paper is encouraged, for example, because laptops can distract both the note-taker and those sitting near them, and notebook notes tend to be more varied, not simply copied from the lecturer verbatim. Both organising information and using it to test your knowledge, rather than just passively writing and rereading notes, is also likely to boost your memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that students weren’t always using these techniques — and when it came to those taking online courses, only half of participants were even taking notes. This is concerning, the team notes, because to really learn properly, you can’t just rewatch recordings. So brush up on the research if you want to avoid these students’ mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask yourself a “prequestion”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working out what you want to get out of a lecture before it happens might help, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/06/heres-a-simple-way-to-boost-your-learning-from-videos-the-prequestion/&quot;&gt;as research from &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition&lt;/em&gt; suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Students were shown an informational video before answering questions about what they’d seen. Those who had been given two “prequestions” related to the information &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; watching outperformed those who had not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believed that this technique was especially effective for learning from videos: it’s not easy to skip through video content to find answers to those prequestions, so viewers likely end up paying more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about what you want to get out of a video lecture or webinar before you watch it might therefore help you retain more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set your goals early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prequestions can work on a small scale — and asking yourself questions about wider goals can also help in the grander scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One piece of research suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131510001260&quot;&gt;students were generally unprepared for the levels of self-directed learning&lt;/a&gt; that online courses necessitate — there is far less direction and routine, after all, than in a traditional learning setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that students consider a number of factors before they start online courses. First, think about what your learning needs are and what resources are available to help you with them. Then, consider what specific strategies you think might be helpful for you personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, try to set yourself learning outcomes and evaluate how successfully you achieved them at the end of the course — this may help you hone your study technique for future classes, courses or modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work on your concentration &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at a screen all day can be tiring — after several hours of Zoom, it can be hard to keep focused. So working out how best to boost your concentration might help you out, and there’s lots of different research that might inspire you. One study claimed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/03/24/working-at-a-treadmill-desk-boosts-your-memory-and-concentration-researchers-claim/&quot;&gt;treadmill desks helped memory and concentration&lt;/a&gt;; another &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/12/18/what-does-a-doodle-do-it-boosts-your-memory-and-concentration/&quot;&gt;suggests that doodling can do the same&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re reaching for your fidget spinner, however, you might be disappointed: one 2019 study &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/25/using-fidget-spinners-may-actually-impede-learning/&quot;&gt;suggested that they can impede learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get socialising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional methods, online learning can be solitary: you’re at home on your own, with minimal time to socialise with your coursemates. But as well as boosting your social life, encouraging discussions between peers can help learning stay on track too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prper/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.020107&quot;&gt;discussing course material with other students in online forums may improve outcomes&lt;/a&gt;: the students who were most active in the learning forums were more likely to achieve a higher final grade. Some of this will obviously be to do with motivation and effort — students who put in a lot of effort studying and working on papers are also more likely to put effort into engaging with classmates. But active learning can’t hurt, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start later if you need to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the night owls out there, online learning is somewhat perfect: there’s no need to do much more than roll out of bed and switch on a computer to make that pesky 9am lecture, and if you miss it you can always watch later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And according to one 2017 study, later start times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00188/full&quot;&gt;may benefit many undergraduates&lt;/a&gt;:  students who started and finished later, working between 11am and 9.30pm, had the best learning outcomes. The team suggested that asynchronous online classes might help provide for people with all kinds of sleep schedules — so whenever you get out of bed, online learning may work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones have made work easier in lots of ways, but they can also come with an added helping of stress, pinging with notifications even outside of working hours. This is such a problem that the French government has taken action, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38479439&quot;&gt;giving workers the “right to disconnect”&lt;/a&gt; from out of hours correspondence from colleagues or bosses — and it can be even more difficult when your home is also where you work or learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study from the University of Illinois published this year also &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/job.2461&quot;&gt;highlighted the stress of this always-on approach&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at a group of teachers, the team found that those with better boundary tactics — keeping work email alerts turned off on smartphones, for example — experienced less work intrusion. Setting such boundaries may help you concentrate when you’re online for work or university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get enough sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep has many cognitive benefits. Periods of sleep between studying &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/&quot;&gt;can help you learn faster&lt;/a&gt; and retain those memories for longer, for instance — so you might want to stock up on herbal teas before term starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; you’ve got a good night’s sleep &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/30/placebo-sleep-can-boost-your-mental-performance/&quot;&gt;may act as an effective placebo&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of how much sleep you’ve actually had or how high quality it was. And if you can’t sleep? Don’t stress. Some research suggests insomnia doesn’t have to ruin your life, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/19/feeling-sleepy-six-findings-that-reveal-the-nuanced-effects-of-poor-sleep/&quot;&gt;how we think about sleep&lt;/a&gt; is nearly as important as how much we get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find your own strategies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following advice is all well and good — but you might be better off finding your own strategies when it comes to productive work. A recent study published in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences &lt;/em&gt;looked at behavioural interventions in online learning, finding that &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921417117&quot;&gt;general strategies were not that helpful for students&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the team suggests, students and teachers alike should understand their specific needs and the context in which they’re working; if a student has ongoing issues with their internet connection, they’re not going to need advice about self-regulation, while those who find it hard to wake up in the morning might. Working on &lt;em&gt;personalised&lt;/em&gt; strategies, therefore, might benefit you the most in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What is hypothetical thinking? We do it continually. Consider making a decision, from choosing what to eat to choosing what to do about a dangerous disease. In deciding between options, you have to consider each of them, working out what’s likely to happen &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;  you take it, then compare the results. A natural human way to do that is by &lt;em&gt;imagining&lt;/em&gt; taking the given option, and following through that scenario, still “offline” in imagination, but constrained by your background sense of reality. That sense includes innate or learned patterns of expectation about what will happen next, of how things and people in general tend to behave; it also includes your knowledge of your local environment and its particular inhabitants. It may be informed by modern science. Unfortunately, it may also be distorted by various sorts of prejudice and error. Still, we often have to rely on our ability to preview options hypothetically, because we cannot try them all before deciding. Choosing the right option first time can be a matter of life or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothetical thinking is used for theoretical purposes as well as practical ones. For example, when a mathematician wants to prove that every number with a property P also has a property Q, the most straightforward way to do it is by &lt;em&gt;supposing&lt;/em&gt; that an unspecified number &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; has P, then proving from that hypothesis that &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; also has Q. For that shows that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; has P, &lt;em&gt;then x&lt;/em&gt; has Q. Since &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; could be any number with P, the argument establishes that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; number with P also has Q.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can get more precise about what such cases have in common. They all involve a procedure for assessing conditional statements of the form “If X, then Y.” For instance, “X” could be “It rains” and “Y” “The match will be cancelled”, or “X” could be “I try to swim across the river” and “Y” “I’ll reach the other side.” The procedure is this. First, suppose X. Then, on that hypothesis, assess Y, using whatever background information is appropriate. Finally, whatever attitude you take to Y on the hypothesis X, take the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; attitude unconditionally to “If X, then Y.” Thus, if you &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; the conclusion “I’ll reach the other side” on the hypothesis “I try to swim across the river” (the current is slow, you are a strong swimmer), you unconditionally &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; the conditional statement “If I try to swim the river, I’ll reach the other side.” But if you &lt;em&gt;reject&lt;/em&gt; the conclusion “I’ll reach the other side” on the hypothesis “I try to swim across the river” (the current is fast, you are a weak swimmer), you unconditionally &lt;em&gt;reject&lt;/em&gt; the conditional statement. We may call that procedure the &lt;em&gt;Suppositional Rule&lt;/em&gt;. Although its explicit articulation in words is quite abstract, we implicitly use it in practice all the time. It comes so naturally to us that it may seem almost trivial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we fail to realize, in unreflectively applying the Suppositional Rule, is that it contains a hidden logical inconsistency. That can be proved in several different ways; &lt;em&gt;Suppose and Tell&lt;/em&gt; has the details. Thus it cannot be 100% reliable. But that does not mean that it is completely useless. It works well enough for practical purposes in most ordinary applications. When restricted to acceptance on the basis of mathematical proof, it works perfectly. But the unrestricted rule, which we use in everyday life, subtly generates contradictions in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Suppositional Rule is what psychologists call a &lt;em&gt;heuristic&lt;/em&gt;, a way of answering questions of some kind which is quick and easy to use, but only imperfectly reliable. For example, when we are asked which personal names in a list are the most common, with no access to statistics, we may use their psychological accessibility as a heuristic, a guide to their frequency. In vision, we may use discontinuities in colour as a guide to the edges of solid objects; camouflage exploits the limitations of that heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inconsistency of our heuristic for conditionals helps explain why logicians have had so much trouble understanding the meaning of conditional statements in natural languages. It was already a matter of controversy amongst the ancient Greeks, more than two thousand years ago. The poet Callimachus wrote: “Even the crows on the rooftops are cawing about the question ‘Which conditionals are true?’” It is just as hotly contested today amongst philosophers and linguists. The trouble was that we didn’t realize just what rule we were applying, so its inconsistency was unclear. This affected even the data on which discussion relied, which largely consisted of sample sentences classified as “correct” or “incorrect”—using the inconsistent heuristic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can such a logically flawed heuristic serve us so well in practice? As with other paradoxes uncovered by philosophers, in practice we can get a long way by backing off whenever we bump into a paradox, without trying to understand what it is we have stumbled across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@thanospal?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Thanos Pal&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/exploring-hypothetical-thinking/&quot;&gt;Exploring hypothetical thinking&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/631888840/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/631888840/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/english-idioms-about-family-life-and-conjugal-felicity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;English idioms about family life and conjugal felicity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/conjunction-dysfunction/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Conjunction dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s well-known that psychology has a problem with generalisability. Studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/10/psychology-research-is-still-fixated-on-a-tiny-fraction-of-humans-heres-how-to-fix-that/&quot;&gt;overwhelmingly involve “WEIRD” participants&lt;/a&gt;: those who are western and educated, from industrialised, rich and democratic societies. And while there is increasing recognition that other populations need better representation in research, many psychologists still often draw sweeping conclusions about humanity based on results from a narrow portion of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620927269?journalCode=sppa&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science &lt;/em&gt;suggests that this problem may have had another, more insidious effect. The authors argue that &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of psychology’s traditionally narrow focus, we’ve ended up implicitly assuming that results of studies on WEIRD groups — particularly white Americans — are somehow more universally generalisable than those from other populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39988&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Bobby Cheon at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, looked at the way in which participant samples were described in the titles of psychology papers. Their logic was simple: article titles are written to get across the most important bits of information about a study, which includes highlighting key features of the sample that might constrain how applicable the results are. For instance, if a study is conducted on children, this will probably be mentioned in the title, so that the reader immediately knows that the results may not apply to adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, some study titles include information about participants’ ethnicity or country of origin. Again, the implication is that the results might not apply to people outside of that group. So if I’m a US-based researcher looking at how access to parks influences our mental health, I might call my study either “The role of green space in the mental wellbeing of adults”, or “The role of green space in the mental wellbeing of American adults”. The latter suggests that the results might not apply in, say, the United Kingdom or India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team looked at the titles of 2,088 articles published in 49 prominent psychology journals between 2004 and 2017, all of which were picked out because the title specifically mentioned the ethnicity, nationality, culture or race of participants. Just 14.7% of these titles mentioned that participants were of American origin, and 34.8% mentioned a sample from a WEIRD region outside of the US (e.g. “Exercise improves healthy diet: Evidence from an Australian sample”). These figures were both significantly lower than the 50.5% that mentioned a sample from a non-WEIRD region (e.g. “Bidirectional engagement among Indian students and teachers”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that research on non-WEIRD groups so often mentions participants’ origins in the title implies a belief that these studies might not generalise but rather only apply to that specific culture. By comparison, the fewer instances of titles mentioning participants’ origin for research conducted on WEIRD groups, and on Americans in particular, suggests these groups are considered more representative of humanity as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the vast majority of psychology research is conducted on WEIRD participants and North American samples in particular; according to some analyses, participants from Asia, Africa and Latin America are included in just a small percentage of papers in leading psychology journals. So it’s not the case that the small number of titles specifying American samples is due to there being fewer papers on Americans in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there may often be the best of intentions behind calling out under-represented groups in the title of papers, particularly when we are used to psychologists studying white, Western participants by default. But as the authors point out, “the bias in the tendency to qualify sample characteristics in titles may reflect and/or reinforce a subtle form of infrahumanization … in which the nature, experiences, and behaviors of some populations are assumed to be a better reflection of humanity than others.” And, unfortunately, the team found that this bias has actually got worse in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second analysis, the researchers looked at the titles of a further 945 articles from around the world which specified that the research had been conducted on a minority group from that country. The vast majority of these (85.4%) were from the United States (e.g. “Developmental trajectories of African American youths”). In contrast, the team only found 32 titles which specified that a sample consisted of white Americans. This suggests that within the United States, results from white Americans are considered more generalisable than those from minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the solution? The researchers say there should be standardised practices for reporting the population being studied. Editors also have a responsibility, they add:  journals should avoid framing research conducted outside of the United States as “cultural”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d add that outlets reporting on psychology research — including &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt;! — also need to be more aware of the way they frame research.  It’s important to acknowledge the limitations of research, and that often involves explaining who the participants in a study were. But it becomes a problem if you consistently highlight the limitations of generalising from studies on participants from China or Brazil, for instance, while describing American or UK-based research in generic terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620927269?journalCode=sppa&quot;&gt;How USA-Centric Is Psychology? An Archival Study of Implicit Assumptions of Generalizability of Findings to Human Nature Based on Origins of Study Samples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are fairly good arguments for optimism and pessimism both. Optimists, who see the best in everything, are likely to have a sunnier disposition; pessimists, on the other hand, would argue that their negative expectations never leave them disappointed when the worst actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the end, it might be realists who win out. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220934577&quot;&gt;study published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, being realistic about your life outcomes is likely to make you happier than overestimating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39985&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David de Meza from the London School of Economics and Chris Dawson from the University of Bath examined data from 1,601 individuals who took part in the British Household Panel Survey between 1991 and 2009. This longitudinal survey covers a range of topics including health, finances, household composition and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team looked first at &lt;em&gt;unrealistic&lt;/em&gt; optimism. Unlike optimism, this isn’t simply a belief that something good might happen, but an “excessive belief in the probability of good realisations” that is so strong you are likely to make mistakes in your predictions. To measure levels of unrealistic optimism, two questions were pulled out of the survey: “how do you think you will be financially a year from now?” and “would you say that you are better off, worse off or the same financially than you were a year ago?”. Comparing these expectations year on year with participants’ actual financial situation was the basis for measuring optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at how this unrealistic optimism was related to participants’  psychological wellbeing and life satisfaction. (They also took into account demographic information which has been linked to wellbeing, including marital status, children, monthly income, education attainment, location and consumption of tobacco.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, those with realistic beliefs had higher psychological wellbeing than those with both low and high expectations. The most pessimistic participants had a 37.2% higher level of psychological distress than realists, with optimists not faring much better: they had an 11.8% higher level of distress. Life satisfaction also suffered for both parties: for those holding the most pessimistic expectations there was a 21.8% reduction and for the most optimistic a 13.5% reduction in general wellbeing compared to realists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this was the case, however, is unclear. It could be that optimists end up perpetually disappointed as their expectations fail to materialise, and although pessimists may avoid that disappointment, they may be more likely to experience dread or anxiety before anything even happens. The team also points out that any plan made based on an inaccurate belief is likely to deliver a worse outcome than one based on rationality. Both over- and under-estimating financial outcomes, for example, is unlikely to yield good results: optimists may fail to adequately save, whilst pessimists could avoid profitable opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether unrealistic optimism would also have the same effect in a non-financial domain is yet to be seen. Finances are particularly susceptible to unrealistic optimism, which research has shown tends to be greatest in areas perceived to be under an individual’s control. It would be interesting to know whether similar results are found for an outcome that is completely out of someone’s control — their genetic susceptibility to a particular medical condition, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that optimism in general is a bad thing, and some research has suggested it &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/08/its-possible-to-learn-to-be-more-optimistic/&quot;&gt;has benefits of its own&lt;/a&gt;. But being &lt;em&gt;overly&lt;/em&gt; or unrealistically optimistic may not provide those same effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who consider themselves more realistic than optimistic, however, the study’s results could come as a relief. Culturally, positive thinking is fairly influential, with self-help gurus and wellness influencers often promoting it as a way to achieve life goals; it’s also been the basis of many bestselling books. But, as this study shows, rejecting positive thinking doesn’t have to make you miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220934577&quot;&gt;Neither an Optimist Nor a Pessimist Be: Mistaken Expectations Lower Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://candidcopywriter.com/&quot;&gt;Ananya Ak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of weight bias or “fatphobia”, the social stigma around obesity, has been around for quite a while. Studies have shown that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4381543/&quot;&gt;such stigma is present even among medical professionals&lt;/a&gt;, which negatively impacts quality of care for patients with obesity. Over the years, there have been several instances of doctors attributing medical symptoms to obesity when the symptoms were actually caused by something more serious, like a tumour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about social stigma towards obese pets? Over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/03/12/pet-obesity-majority-us-cats-and-dogs-obese-overweight/3129342002/&quot;&gt;50% of cats and dogs&lt;/a&gt; in the USA are obese and, like humans, pets with obesity have a higher risk of metabolic, respiratory and other diseases. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-020-0622-7&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Obesity &lt;/em&gt;examines whether the same weight bias that affects the delivery of healthcare in humans is prevalent among pet doctors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39979&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The investigation, conducted by a team led by Rebecca Pearl at the University of Pennsylvania, involved two online studies exploring the attitudes of the participants towards obese and lean dogs, and the treatment recommendations they gave the dogs for hypothetical symptoms. One of the studies was conducted on 205 veterinarians and the other on 103 veterinary students, with the methodology remaining identical for both the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies were done in two parts. In the first part, the participants were each randomly shown one of four images featuring either a lean dog and lean owners, an obese dog and lean owners, a lean dog and obese owners, or an obese dog and obese owners. The dogs and owners in each of the vignettes were identical except for their weight status. The participants were then asked questions to determine their emotional response towards the dogs and owners, and perceived causes of the dogs’ weight (e.g. biology/genetics, environmental factors, the owners’ feelings of responsibility, and their behaviours). They were also asked whether they had ever recommended weight loss treatment to the overweight owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both the studies, the participants reported stronger feelings of blame, contempt, disgust and frustration towards the overweight dogs and their owners (irrespective of the owners’ weight) compared to the lean dogs and their owners. They also felt that the owners of the obese dogs were less likely to comply with weight-related treatment recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the participants also seemed biased against the heavier owners. They saw the obese owners as more responsible for their dog’s weight if it was obese than if it was lean. Similarly, the lean owners got the “credit” if their dog was lean, but weren’t seen as so responsible if their dog was obese. So, the veterinarians appeared to make the stereotypical assumption that the overweight owners had poorer health behaviours than the lean owners and were transferring their own bad behaviours to their dogs, making them obese as well. Across both studies, 7-10% of participants also reported that they had previously recommended that pet owners seek weight loss treatment. This might seem like a small number, but, as the authors say, “It is surprising that any participants reported counseling owners about weight, considering that veterinarians are not trained to give health advice to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second part of the study, the participants were told that the dog they had seen was presenting at their clinic with respiratory problems. They were first asked to recommend diagnostic procedures. Then, after being told that the dog was diagnosed with a collapsed trachea, they were asked how they would treat it. The participants gave similar diagnostic recommendations for the dogs irrespective of their weight. But when asked for treatment recommendations, the participants were more likely to recommend weight treatment for the obese dog than the lean dog. This is an acceptable treatment, of course, since weight is one of the causes of poor respiratory health. But focusing on weight may lead veterinarians to miss other potential causes of illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This investigation had its limitations, including that all participants were either students or alumni of the same veterinary school. The sample size was thus quite limited. The focus was also solely on dogs vs. other pets like cats. A larger study with a wider selection of participants and more variety in pets is required to be able to truly generalise the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even with the limitations, this study provides empirical evidence of weight bias among veterinarians. This is significant considering that unlike humans, pets cannot voice their concerns and a wrong diagnosis or treatment recommendation could prove dangerous to our beloved animal friends. Thus, just as interventions are put in place to reduce bias among doctors, steps may need to be taken to ensure that veterinarians remain mindful of their biases while diagnosing and treating pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-020-0622-7&quot;&gt;Who’s a good boy? Effects of dog and owner body weight on veterinarian perceptions and treatment recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2020-07-23T14:58:13+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for the perfect gift can be a pleasure and a curse: the joy of picking &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the right thing vs. the anxiety that you’ve completely missed the mark. Whether to get somebody something luxurious but impractical or something with utility is another common dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also one that may have unintended consequences: while some practical gifts — those that save someone time, for example — can be appealing and well-received, others may fall short. If you were thinking of getting that special someone a gift with the intention of saving them money, for example, think again — you might end up making them feel ashamed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/709887&quot;&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Association for Consumer Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39961&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;If someone is short on money, it’s possible that a gift designed to help them save more could be well received. But, Alice Lee-Yoon from UCLA and colleagues hypothesise, the opposite is actually more likely to happen: people are likely to feel ashamed of such a gift and see it as an indication of either a lower status overall or a greater differential in status between themselves and the gift-giver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 405 participants were asked to write about a gift they had recently been given: either a gift that they felt was intended to save them time, or one intended to save them money. They then rated how much the gift made them feel guilty, embarrassed, ashamed, proud, brave and good, and ranked their status in society and where they felt the gift-giver would rank their own status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, recipients experienced greater feelings of shame, embarrassment and other negative emotions when they felt a gift had been given to save them money — gift cards, coupons or memberships, for example — and also believed that the gift-giver saw themselves as higher in status compared to the participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at real-life gift-giving. Two hundred students were given a $5 Starbucks gift card and instructed to give it to another person within the week. Half of the cards displayed a message indicating the gift was designed to save the recipient time, while the other messages explained the card was designed to save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card included a survey similar to that in the first study for the recipient to fill in. And again, those receiving a gift intending to save money experienced more negative emotions, and believed that the gift-giver saw a greater status differential between the giver and receiver, than those receiving a gift to save time. However, three months later, cards with time saving messages were equally likely to have been redeemed as those with money saving messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a third study participants were asked to imagine coming home after a long day to a friend bringing them dinner from Chipotle, either to save them time or money. They then answered the same questions about negative emotions from the previous study, as well as indicating their experience of resource scarcity — how often had they been short of time or money? Not only did participants again feel more negative emotions when a gift was given to save them money, these were intensified when they had more experience of being short of money. Gifts intended to save the recipient time, however, were not particularly influenced by experience of time scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study looked at whether the intended purpose of a gift could influence decisions about what to buy. The team asked 303 participants to imagine a friend had given them a gift card, this time $30 to spend on Amazon. In the control condition, participants were told their friend was giving them the card with no explanation; in the money stress condition their friend said “I know you’ve been stressed for money”; and in the inadequate money condition said “I know you’ve felt you have had an inadequate amount of money lately”. Participants were also asked how they would use the card — either on a Boston University hoodie or a Harvard University hoodie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status, again, seemed to play a large part. Those in the control condition were less likely to buy the Harvard sweater (which was perceived to be higher status) than those in the money stress or inadequate money conditions, and there was a higher power differential in the latter conditions too. How choosing hoodies in the lab would translate to real world decisions, however, is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do gifts fall flat when picked out to save the recipient money? The team suggests that gift-givers may be focusing too heavily on their own perspective, failing to predict the emotional responses that a recipient low on money might experience. This may be particularly true if the giver has never experienced money scarcity themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also notes that the effect seen in this study might change over time: someone who felt ashamed in the moment might later appreciate having received a money-saving gift from a friend, particularly if their financial situation changes in some way. But for the time being, you’re probably best off avoiding any mention of money when you next hand over that carefully-selected gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/709887&quot;&gt;Overcoming Resource Scarcity: Consumers’ Response to Gifts Intending to Save Time and Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The Black Lives Matter movement in the US and elsewhere has rightly brought about a much-needed reexamination of deeply rooted issues around diversity and equity for minorities and marginalized populations. Structural racism and other inequities, for example around gender or status, continue to affect academia world-wide. At PLOS we recognize that we can do better — our journals can and must play a role in addressing concerns around diversity, equity and inclusion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are not new concerns, and we have been working to make our journals a home for diverse voices. However, we recognize that we need to step up our efforts in a number of areas and commit to doing so. For our journals, this means:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will &lt;strong&gt;assess and survey the diversity of our contributors&lt;/strong&gt;, from the thousands of Academic Editors handling submissions at our journals to our authors and reviewers. This will establish a baseline and allow us to hold ourselves accountable for making measurable positive changes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need to &lt;strong&gt;improve the diversity of our journals and their leadership&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes our internal staff but also our Academic Editors appointed to senior roles. We need to ensure that our journals are representative of broader society as well as the academic community, and that the voices of different communities or groups of researchers are heard and play an integral role in our journals. We commit to proactively seeking out underrepresented communities to redress the balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will continue our efforts to &lt;strong&gt;ensure that all manuscript handling processes are set up to recognize and minimize bias&lt;/strong&gt;. We are reflecting internally on how we can improve our understanding of these issues and minimise any of our own biases, and will work with our Academic Editors and peer reviewers to address any form of bias against authors or their origin in the handling of submitted manuscripts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within the scope of each of our journals we &lt;strong&gt;aim to be a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;publishing platform for research that studies inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations&lt;/strong&gt;. In doing so, we need to ensure that the study of these populations recognizes the problem of racism and inequalities, and that the topic is covered appropriately in published papers. We need to be mindful of inappropriate discussions of race in relationship with genetics traits for example. Inequalities and racism do affect the well-being of minority populations, and this needs to be considered in public health research settings as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have the obligation to continue to &lt;strong&gt;uphold the highest standards of ethics&lt;/strong&gt;. Research about minorities or other affected populations needs to be conducted to the highest editorial standards and ethics guidelines, and should award credit to contributors from these communities as appropriate.  We will not publish research intended to directly support oppression or persecution. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these commitments are items that we will be able to address swiftly, whereas others will take more time to achieve. This topic will therefore be a regular feature on PLOS Blogs, so watch this space. We are committed to pursue these activities in the short as well as long term, and to facilitate change not just at PLOS’ journals, but also in the broader academic community where possible. We count on your support in this endeavor and will appreciate any feedback, help or suggestions for specific actions to take. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;What does early sharing accomplish?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientific discovery is a process of continuous vetting and refinement. While immediate access to the latest findings allows for accelerated discoveries, sharing early and transparently also results in more checkpoints throughout the research process for communities to provide feedback. The need for effective and time-sensitive global collaboration has been further emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adopting early sharing practices helps ensure your research is available as soon as it’s needed, regardless of your field. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early sharing allows for the latest research to be connected without waiting for the final publication. Whether it’s through a preprint, open data set, or accessible protocol, researchers are empowered to cite the latest discoveries in their current research. Learning how and when researchers have adopted early sharing is the first step to contributing to this global movement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sharing Before the Study Takes Place&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research question being pursued and the resulting study design create the foundation of a research project. These core elements are often internally reviewed to ensure the resulting study is as sound and focused as possible, but the greater research community typically doesn’t see the methodology of a study until the results and conclusions are published. By preregistering your study protocol early, you enable broader research assessment to begin at the foundation of a study. The study design itself goes through peer review so that potential improvements or flaws are detected before the study actually takes place. When the final research article is ready to be assessed, editors can consider the study’s rigor and adherence to the study design.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help ensure a study follows the highest standards and has long-term reproducibility, &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; both offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;preregistration options&lt;/a&gt;. Preregistration can help reduce confirmation bias of editors and reviewers by confirming the underlying validity of your research. Additionally, having your protocol published allows others to pursue your study, or to tweak your design to fit their available resources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sharing Initial Findings&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; announced two new &lt;a href=&quot;https://biologue.plos.org/2020/04/14/new-linked-article-types-enable-researchers-to-publish-findings-as-their-work-progresses/&quot;&gt;linked articles types&lt;/a&gt;: Discovery Reports and Update Articles. To alleviate the pressure of having to wait for a fully formed story to develop, Discovery Articles give researchers the flexibility to publish novel initial findings and as a first step. Once the Discovery Report is published, both the original authors and other research groups can augment the initial report by submitting Update Articles for review. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As multiple Update Articles can be linked to a single Discovery Report, your initial finding can spring into a series of interconnected advancements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sharing Before Publication&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preprints provide a platform for open, public review that is independent from a journal and doesn’t depend on an invitation from the editor. While the original preprint can be viewed and cited prior to publication, the preprint can be updated as the manuscript is revised to ensure the most recent version of your paper is always available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS makes the interaction between preprint servers and our journals as simple as possible. You can directly submit your preprint to our journals from medRxiv and bioRxiv, or you can include the DOI of your preprint on the submission form if you used a different server. For those in other subjects, there is an ever-growing collection of active &lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers&quot;&gt;preprint servers&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, authors of life science articles can opt-in to have the paper uploaded to bioRxiv during submission, without any additional work. Our editors are encouraged to consider comments left on a preprint, allowing for the open review platform that preprints provide to potentially accelerate and deepen the review process. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, open and accessible data sets are another opportunity to collaborate among far-spanning researchers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/a-selfish-reason-to-share-research-data/&quot;&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that publications that link to data in a repository are cited more frequently on average. As many researchers around the world don’t have access to the infrastructure required to generate their own data sets, making your data available without restrictions is an easy way to ensure your research is maximizing its contribution and usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early sharing opens up opportunities throughout the research process to share study designs, initial findings, and data at a global scale. Involve your communities with early sharing practices so that vetting happens throughout the research process, ultimately improving the credibility of your final research output.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of the same groups of individuals known to suffer a disproportionate burden of poor health outcomes are faring especially poorly during this pandemic. In many ways, the disparate outcomes being documented in COVID-19 are simply offering a magnified view of longstanding health inequities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2017/05/what-is-health-equity-.html#:~:text=means%20is%20lacking.-,What%20is%20health%20equity%3F,be%20as%20healthy%20as%20possible.&quot;&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundation&lt;/a&gt; stated that “&lt;em&gt;Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be healthy&lt;/em&gt;“. To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed. Socially disadvantaged people, who have been historically marginalized and/or disfavored by social and political institutions, have faced significant obstacles to health equity in the midst of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-social-distancing.html&quot;&gt;Social distancing&lt;/a&gt;, a key recommendation for preventing the spread of COVID-19, has proven to be very difficult for socially disadvantaged persons. Housing insecurity and homelessness are established risk factors for chronic health conditions, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://kidney360.asnjournals.org/content/1/4/241&quot;&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;. In the setting of COVID-19, these challenges have meant that many individuals cannot feasibly maintain the recommended physical distance from others. Further, for people in service professions that require they interact daily with the public, their ability to socially distance has also been quite challenged. Racial and ethnic minorities and low income persons are overrepresented in such professions, which has increased their risk of COVID-19 exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who have sought testing for COVID-19, inequities in health care access and services have been on full display. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/02/825730141/the-coronavirus-doesnt-discriminate-but-u-s-health-care-showing-familiar-biases?t=1595235018970&quot;&gt;One report&lt;/a&gt; noted that African Americans patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. cough and fever) were less likely to be given a COVID-19 test than were white persons with the same symptoms. This type of biased delivery of health services can lead to socially disadvantaged individuals presenting later (e.g. for hospitalization) with severe symptoms or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Health/beloved-brooklyn-teacher-30-dies-coronavirus-denied-covid/story?id=70376445&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.  As vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 are developed and disseminated, individuals who have directly, or vicariously, experienced bias in the health care setting may be reticent to seek these options, out of fear of inequitable treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 mitigation efforts have led to shortages of food in many communities due to store closures as well as bulk purchases by individuals who can afford to do so. Low-income communities have been particularly affected. A consequence of structural inequities including residential segregation, food access is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379708007290?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;known to vary&lt;/a&gt; by community demographics. In this pandemic, diet-sensitive health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease, may be exacerbated, particularly for persons facing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272638616306722&quot;&gt;food insecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/04/07/game-plan-to-help-those-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-171863&quot;&gt;Solutions&lt;/a&gt; for addressing the inequities magnified by COVID-19 have been offered and include expanding access to testing and health care, and providing social services to keep vulnerable groups safe. People with kidney diseases are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820302556&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Because many are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30899864/&quot;&gt;socially disadvantaged&lt;/a&gt;, it will be important to evaluate and expand the services they are provided, including those addressing social needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimal CAR T therapy validation requires a 3-D cellular system that mimics the complex tumour cellular architecture. In a study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-020-00623-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Dillard et al. report the development of colorectal cysts from a single colorectal cell line Caco-2 as simple and reliable tools to validate CAR T-mediated therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12039&quot; style=&quot;width: 490px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12039 &quot; height=&quot;306&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Fig-1-300x191.png&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Method principle, taken from the original publication.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR T cells are T lymphocytes, genetically engineered to express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) on their surface that recognizes CD19 marker on the surface of B lymphocytes and also promotes signalling events that control the activation of lysis. This results in the destruction of the B lymphocyte. Since CD19 is a widespread marker in cancerous B cells, CAR-T cells are being used as an allogenic treatment of B-cell malignancies.  The CAR T-mediated immunotherapy for cancer has revolutionized the treatment of ‘liquid tumors’, i.e, haematological, however, it hasn’t been so effective in the treatment of solid tumors, as CAR-T cells are unable to survive in the complex tumour microenvironment and target successfully all the tumor-generating cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, using a two-dimensional (2-D) cellular system, in which CAR-T cells are added in a monolayer of cultured target cancer cells, to validate CAR-T cell functionality and specificity, is inadequate, as the 2-D system does not mimic the challenging 3-D morphology and organization of solid tumors. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that cancer cells acquire a different gene expression profile when cultured in 3-D spheroids compared to 2-D, which may affect their recognition by CAR-T cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to create a simple 3-D cellular system that could be used for the validation of CAR-T cells, the authors took advantage of a colorectal cancer cell line, Caco-2, that has been shown to form 3-D cyst-like structures by self-organisation, with the apical surface of the epithelial cells facing a central lumen. First, they transduced Caco-2 cells with the &lt;em&gt;CD19&lt;/em&gt; gene, in a way that ensured cell-surface expression of the CD19 antigen on their surface (CD19Caco-2 cells). Next, they showed that CD19CAR-T cells were able to kill CD19Caco-2 cells, as effectively as in a 2-D culture, while Caco-2 cells remained intact. Finally, they demonstrated that the system was compatible with super-resolution microscopy, high-throughput live imaging and bioluminescence assays; hence the ability of the CAR-T cells to kill the cancer cells and destroy the cyst can be monitored with both qualitative and quantitative methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a simple and versatile method that can be adapted to the use of a variety of cancer lines that have been shown to form similar simple 3-D structures. It could therefore, constitute a powerful tool for the therapeutic validation of CAR-T cells in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bipolar disease is prevalent in homeless people &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Numerous studies have shown that bipolar disease (BD) is a common disorder among homeless people. In a study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08819-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Ayano et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by pulling existing data from the literature, which confirmed and estimated more accurately the high pooled prevalence of BD among homeless people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder (BP) is a mental health condition characterized by lengthy periods of extreme mood swings. BP has a prevalence of about 1-2.4 % in the general population, but has been shown to affect 2.41 to 42.42% of homeless people, depending on the study. BD has a severe negative effect in homeless people and is associated with an increased risk of disability, substance/drug abuse. In order to provide recommendations for future research and clinical practice, the authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. From a total of 3236 articles identifies, only 10 articles met the inclusion criteria for the final systematic review and meta-analysis that was conducted. The studies were performed in five countries/continents (Canada, USA, Brazil, Germany, Ireland and France) and were published between 2001 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the random-effects model to account for existing heterogeneity the pooled BD prevalence among homeless people was estimated at 11.4%. Subgroup analysis by country/continent showed the prevalence of BD to be 10% in Europe and 13.2 %  in other countries, while subgroup analysis by the quality of the studies showed a pooled BD prevalence of 9.9% for high-quality studies and 11.8% for both low and moderate-quality studies. These numbers are significantly higher than the ones reported for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12034 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/homeless-person-HL-blog-July-2020-300x270.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likely reasons for this increased between BD and homelessness is the co-occurrence of other medical conditions, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, which have been associated with an increased risk of bipolar and other mental illnesses. Also, the possible exposure of homeless people to physical and sexual trauma, which is associated with the onset of manic episodes and bipolar disease in risky groups, may also be a factor. Moreover, the higher co-existence of depression, anxiety, psychosis and alcohol-related disorders in homeless people may also constitute a possible reason for the higher prevalence of BD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the importance of further high-quality studies to determine the etiologies of the high prevalence of BD observed in homeless people and of targeted interventions to prevent and diagnose BD in these individuals. The authors recommend the strengthening of the mental health services for homeless people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating committed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of the shipping industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shipping industry has one of the highest carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions and needs to take action to reduce such emissions as soon as possible. In a study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcenergy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42500-020-00015-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bullock et al. analyses for the first time the committed emissions of the shipping sector taking into consideration individual ship type data from existing and new ships and assesses which measures should be taken to reduce baseline committed emissions to meet the Paris agreement goals for action on climate change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris agreement goal is to keep the increase of global temperature below 2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep the temperature rise below 1.5 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. For this to be achieved global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions need to be reduced as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping sector is the main contributor of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, estimated at around 800 MtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year, hence it has set a target of at least 50% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 2050 compared to 2008.  However, until now the committed emissions of shipping, i.e., the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions expected based on existing energy infrastructure, are based on assumptions of ship lifetimes extrapolated from other transport systems. The average scrappage age of ships is 28 years, which is much higher than road transport vehicles, therefore, this practice underestimates committed emissions in shipping. As a result, the ‘carbon budget’, which is the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that can be emitted over time while limiting global warming to the accepted levels of the Paris agreement for shipping industry is estimated to be higher for the shipping industry, than it really should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study the authors analysed committed emissions in 11,000 existing and new ships in the European Union’s new emissions monitoring scheme (EU MRV), taking into account the wide range of ship types, as well as their different sizes and scrappage age, using datasets published for the first time in 2019. It was found that five ship types: container, bulk carriers, ro pax, oil tankers and passenger ships are responsible for 71% of committed emissions, with the highest baseline committed emissions estimated for container ships. In particular, the new containers account for the highest committed emissions, as although they are more efficient, they are much larger than older containers and this has a greater impact. Moreover, passenger ships were found to have disproportionately high emissions, despite their small numbers, due to their long life time. Overall the baseline committed emissions from all existing ships in the EU MRV fleet was found to be 2260 MtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, much larger than estimated in previous studies. This is equivalent to 85-212% of the carbon budget to achieve the 1.5 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C target that is available for the EU MRV fleet, therefore, significant mitigation measures are required to reduce these figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12040&quot; style=&quot;width: 428px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12040&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/fig4-300x257.png&quot; width=&quot;418&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Committed emissions for existing ships, from the 10 largest ship types through time, taken from the original article.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the combination of four measures: slow speed, technical and operational improvements, fuel blending and the use of zero-carbon fuel, if implemented between 2020s-2030s has the potential to reduce the baseline committed emissions by 65% to 793 MtCO2 and achieve the target of keeping within the Paris agreement carbon budgets, without the need for premature scrappage. However, any delay in appropriate implementation would result in a reduction of only 13% of committed emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that we cannot rely on measures to improve the efficiency of new ships in order to deliver what is decided in the Paris agreement and highlights the need to implement measures on existing ships, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilot study finds: Modified short-term fasting reduces chemotherapy toxicity in gynaecological cancer patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chemotherapy-induced toxicity results in patients postponing chemotherapy or in the reduction of the drugs dose used, thus compromising therapy. There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that short-term fasting prior to the onset of chemotherapy has beneficial effects in tolerating chemotherapy. In study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-020-07041-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Zorn at al. report a significant reduction of toxicity-related symptoms in patients with gynecological cancer, achieved in a controlled cross-over pilot study that used a modified short-term fasting (mSTF) protocol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxicity is a common side effect of chemotherapy, a consequence of healthy cells being destroyed together with the cancer cells by the drug cocktail. Fasting is believed to protect normal cells from the detrimental effects of chemotherapy, as they enter a state of reduced cell division and stress resistance, upregulation of DNA repair and induced autophagy. In tumor cells on the other hand, growth pathways remain activated, which renders them more sensitive to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case series study human patients under various fasting regimens were reported to show significantly fewer toxicity-induced symptoms, such as fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea, while a randomized control trial showed that a 48-h fasting reduced bone marrow toxicity and DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, a dose-escalation fasting study demonstrated that 72h fasting during chemotherapy was safe and tolerated by the patients, while it resulted in reduced chemotherapy-related toxicity and low-grade fasting-related toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this pilot study the authors evaluated the effect of a 96-h fasting on the chemotherapy-induced toxicity in women with gynecological cancer. For the first time the effect of a 6-day intervention of Ketone diet (KD) prior to mSTF on ameliorating the negative effects of fasting was also assessed. The mSTF itself had a ketogenic composition (75% fat, 15% protein and 10% carbohydrate), as it has been shown that fasting achieves best results in a state of ketosis (elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood). The patients, who underwent a calorie restriction to 25% of their daily requirement, as a result of mSTF tolerated the fasting well and experienced much less severe symptoms of chemotherapy-induced toxicity: significantly fewer patients suffered from stomatitis, headaches and weakness and patients also showed significantly less haematological parameters of toxicity during mSTF cycles. Although previous studies had reported reduced cases of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after STF, in this particular study, this was not observed, possibly because the patients had already overcome these conditions due to preventive medication. Importantly, the patients on mSTM postponed much fewer chemotherapy appointments than the ones on normal diet, which reflects their better tolerance of their treatment and physical condition in general. It was also found that the KD neither reduced fasting-related discomfort nor improved compliance of the fasting regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results clearly show the potential of mSTF in counteracting chemotherapy-related toxicity and enhancing tolerance of treatment. Further larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of mSTF as a supportive approach to chemotherapy, before recommending this treatment to cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

WLHIV who do not stay in care do not receive antiretroviral therapy and are at increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1511691&quot;&gt;risk of passing HIV&lt;/a&gt; to their child or partner and may also experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737584/&quot;&gt;worse&lt;/a&gt; HIV-related health outcomes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20190722_UNAIDS_SFSFAF_2019_en.pdf&quot;&gt;UNAIDS estimate&lt;/a&gt; that about 1 in 5 HIV-exposed children in Ghana become infected with HIV by the time of cessation of breastfeeding. This rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the second-highest in West Africa and the fourth-highest among the 21 focus countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20190722_UNAIDS_SFSFAF_2019_en.pdf&quot;&gt;UNAIDS tracks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons why the drop-out rates of HIV care are higher in the postpartum year than during pregnancy are not well understood. Researchers have offered &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111421&quot;&gt;several theories&lt;/a&gt;:  women may fall out of care due to fewer scheduled encounters with the healthcare system, due to a decline in perceived susceptibility of MTCT after childbirth, due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24977376/&quot;&gt;prioritization&lt;/a&gt; of their child’s health over their own, or due to challenges with childcare — but there is little evidence to support any one of these theories over the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To contribute toward a better understanding of this issue, we conducted qualitative interviews with thirty postpartum WLHIV in Ghana, recruited in 2016 from two tertiary hospitals in the urban city of Accra. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03067-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presents the barriers women themselves described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple barriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women’s accounts suggest that social, economic, and physical health factors, more than a change in individual motivation, may explain why fewer women remain in HIV care in the postpartum year than during pregnancy. Broadly, we found that the social and economic costs of staying in HIV care became higher in the postpartum year and many who dropped out experienced multiple barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghana has the potential to eliminate MTCT of HIV; doing so will require a concerted and deliberate effort to support postpartum WLHIV to stay in HIV care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ART-related side-effects and HIV denial were the strongest barriers during pregnancy and the fear of re-experiencing the ART-side effects continued to keep mothers away from HIV care even after childbirth. One participant shared her story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During pregnancy, I suffered when I took the drugs due to the side-effects. Thus, anytime I thought of going back for the drugs [after the birth], the thoughts of the side effects came to my mind and troubled me. I became afraid. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge of travel and transport&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One unique barrier in the early postpartum months was difficulty traveling to HIV care due to complications from childbirth or prolonged recovery from a cesarean section. For example, one mother remarked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most mothers will tell you that the first six months are very tough. Many women take the time to work on themselves since some undergo an operation [i.e., C-section]. Others, too, had a vaginal tear, so they may need some time to take care of themselves. It takes six months or more for a mother to return to a normal life after childbirth [i.e., to be healthy and to visit the HIV treatment centers for care]. Some, too, are single mothers who have no support at home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, for a few of the women who had dropped out of care, childbirth was associated with debt, unemployment, or underemployment. This led to a new reliance on others, such as a partner or relative, to give them money before they could make their HIV care visits, even when their motivation to stay in HIV care was high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12020 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Fotolia_17246913_Subscription_XL-300x174.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Mode of transportation was the most significant barrier, with increasing costs to mothers facing new sociocultural pressures unique to the postpartum year. Postpartum mothers were motivated to protect their children’s health, and often felt obligated to take a taxi to their clinical appointments instead of the cheaper local bus, called &lt;em&gt;trotro, &lt;/em&gt;which they typically took during pregnancy. Taxis could protect their children from the risk of illness and excessive heat common to the hot and crowded &lt;em&gt;trotros, &lt;/em&gt;but they were more expensive, costing one participant 70% of her monthly salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIV stigma also contributed to high transportation costs, as some mothers established their HIV care far from their home to avoid being recognized. Further, those who now needed to rely on financial or childcare support to make it to appointments in their postpartum year would find it difficult to do so without disclosing their HIV status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priority of pediatric care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these economic and social challenges, one would expect that mothers who had discontinued from HIV care would also be unable to adhere to their pediatric HIV testing or child well-baby visit schedules. However, we found that all the mothers who had dropped out of HIV care, except one, were engaged with the healthcare system for their child’s health. This behavior suggests that in the context of limited resources, mothers prioritized their children’s health over their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close the pregnancy-postpartum HIV-care retention gap, our results call for a package of interventions that minimize the economic burden of accessing HIV care, diminish stigma, and enhance the management of ART-related side effects. The women in our study recommended that HIV-care providers in Ghana consider extending their medication refills from three to six months. This option will not only reduce transportation costs, but it will also allow mothers to recover physically from childbirth. Ghana has the potential to eliminate MTCT of HIV; doing so will require a concerted and deliberate effort to support postpartum WLHIV to stay in HIV care.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite this, many myths and misconceptions abound that are significant barriers to both treatment and public understanding of eating disorders. Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, gender, or cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve put together a list of books that provide practical information to dispel misconceptions, as well as guidance for people affected by eating disorders and their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/if-your-adolescent-has-an-eating-disorder-9780190076825&quot;&gt;If Your Adolescent Has An Eating Disorder: An Essential Guide for Parents &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;B.

The book dispels common myths about eating disorders, such as the notion that they occur only amongst the affluent, that they affect only girls and women, or that they simply result from environmental factors such as the fashion industry and society’s obsession with thinness. This book is essential reading for those seeking authoritative and current information about these often-misunderstood illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-void-inside-9780190061166&quot;&gt;The Void Inside: Bringing Purging Disorder to Light&lt;/a&gt; by Pamela K. Keel&lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/void-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book chronicles the growing recognition of purging disorder at the turn of the millennium, reviews what science has taught us about the illness, and explains the medical complications that purging may bring. The author, known for her work identifying and naming purging disorder, presents irrefutable evidence that it can no longer be considered a subset of better-known eating disorders. Keel illuminates how the illness impacts the lives of real people to underscore the severity of this hidden eating disorder and the need for greater awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/exposure-therapy-for-eating-disorders-9780190069742&quot;&gt;Exposure Therapy for Eating Disorders  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;by Carolyn Black Becker, Nicholas R. Farrell, and Glenn Waller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is designed to augment existing eating disorder treatment manuals by providing clinicians with practical advice for maximizing the effectiveness of exposure, regardless of clinical background or evidence-based treatment used. Suitable for use with a range of diagnoses, this easy-to-use guide describes the most up to date empirical research on exposure for eating disorders. The book also provides strategies for overcoming obstacles, including institutional resistance to implementation of exposure therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/handbook-of-positive-body-image-and-embodiment-9780190841874&quot;&gt;Handbook of Positive Body Image and Embodiment  &lt;/a&gt;by Tracy L.

Presenting chapters by world-renowned experts in body image and eating behaviors, the handbook explores how therapeutic interventions and public health and policy initiatives can inform scholarly, clinical, and prevention-based work in the field of eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eating-disorders-the-facts-9780198715603&quot;&gt;Eating Disorders: The Facts &lt;/a&gt;by Suzanne Abraham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sympathetically and clearly written, this guide considers why eating disorders occur, and then looks at each in turn, describing the eating behaviours, diagnosis, and treatments available. Case histories and patient perspectives provide insights into the mind of the eating disorder sufferer, making it easier for patients and their families to relate to the topics discussed. The book&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides an authoritative resource on eating disorders that will prove valuable for sufferers and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These titles highlight some of the most pressing issues in the field of eating disorder research. Greater awareness among stakeholders – including healthcare workers, researchers, policymakers, and the general public – can address ongoing challenges and inform future directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/vintage-book-light-bulb-wood-table_1007385.htm&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by jannoon028 via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/six-books-to-help-us-understand-eating-disorders/&quot;&gt;Six books to help us understand eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/630516433/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/630516433/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f07%2feating-dis-147x220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/why-chemical-imbalance-is-the-wrong-way-to-talk-about-depression/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why chemical imbalance is the wrong way to talk about depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/work-life-balance-5333802_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us find it increasingly difficult to separate our work from our personal lives. Modern technologies exacerbate the problem, with our inability to ‘switch off’ and tendency to take calls and check emails outside of working hours. What’s more, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new challenge for those of us working from home, where the line between our jobs and family lives has become even more blurred, and for those working longer shifts in hospitals, supermarkets or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is already known that work-life imbalances can negatively affect both our physical and mental health. However, we know little about the factors that strengthen or weaken this association. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09139-w/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;New research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looks at the influence of gender and level of welfare provision by the state on the link between work-life balance and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Mensah and Adjei analyze data from over 32,000 workers, aged 16 to 64, from 30 European countries. This data was collected as part of the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; European Working Conditions Survey, carried out in 2015 by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound)&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors perform statistical analysis on the association between work-life balance and self-reported health, which previous studies have found to be a reliable proxy of overall health, and factor in other variables such as gender and welfare regime. Validating earlier studies, the results show that there is a significant association between work-life balance and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender differences in the association between work-life conflict and health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional gender roles permeate our everyday levels such that, in many cultures, women more often take on a caring role within the family unit and men are seen as the so-called ‘breadwinner’. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/12951&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;This is changing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the last 40 years seeing increased participation of women in the labor market and a rise in the number of dual-earning families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is generally a stronger association between poor work-life balance and poor health among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, does gender affect the association between work-life conflict and self-reported health? Mensah and Adjei find that while men more often report a poor work-life balance across different European countries, there is generally a stronger association between poor work-life balance and poor health among women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a number of reasons for this. Women still bear the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/familiesandthelabourmarketengland/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;greater burden of childcare responsibilities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, creating additional pressures at home as well as in the workplace. Women also face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/13/workplace-gender-discrimination-remains-rife-survey-finds&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;increased discrimination at work and lower rates of pay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, both of which may contribute to the impact of work-life conflict on health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of the welfare state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12015 size-medium alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/postit-240x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;The strength of this study’s large cross-European sample is that it enables comparison between groups of countries with different welfare regimes, with countries classified as Nordic (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway), Conservative (such as Germany and Switzerland), Liberal (UK and Ireland), Southern Europe (such as Greece, Spain and Italy) and Central and Eastern Europe (including Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Croatia and others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mensah and Adjei report that work-life balance is best for both working men and women in the Nordic countries. There is also a weaker association between poor work-life balance and poor self-reported health in these countries, which the authors attribute to their substantial welfare provision including availability of childcare, universal healthcare and long parental leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association between work-life conflict and poor health is strongest in countries with Liberal and Conservative welfare regimes, with Conservative states also being the only ones where the association is stronger in men than in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors may be at play here, including increased emphasis on the male breadwinner role, weaker employment regulation and unions, and more stringent social welfare than the Nordic states. However, it remains to be established why Southern European states, with the least generous welfare policies, fared better. Further work is also needed to determine the specific contribution of individual policies on work-life conflict and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking a healthy balance in future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, the findings of this study may help us to reflect on how often we allow commitments at work encroach on our personal lives and negatively impact our health. So how might we guard against the stresses and strains of work-life conflict in future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mental Health Foundation, a UK charity, recommends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/w/work-life-balance&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a number of measures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; including better prioritization of tasks at work, taking proper breaks in the working day, dedicating time for exercise or hobbies, and keeping a record of time spent working or thinking about work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differential impact of working practices, employment law and welfare policies on women and men’s health must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also points to systemic differences to be addressed by governments and policymakers. As we strive towards equality, the differential impact of working practices, employment law and welfare policies on women and men’s health must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, countries vary widely in political and economic landscape and so too does the level of social and financial intervention by the state, but strategies to help minimize work-life conflict would surely pay dividends in fostering a healthier population and workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little is known about how our brains dynamically adapt for efficient functioning. Most
previous work has focused on analyzing changes in co-fluctuations between a set of
brain regions over several temporal segments of the data. We argue that by
collapsing data in space or time, we stand to lose useful information about the brain’s
dynamical organization. Here we use Topological Data Analysis to reveal the overall
organization of whole-brain activity maps at a single-participant level—as an
interactive representation—without arbitrarily collapsing data in space or time. Using
existing multitask fMRI datasets, with the known ground truth about the timing of
transitions from one task-block to next, our approach tracks both within- and
between-task transitions at a much faster time scale (~4–9 s) than before. The
individual differences in the revealed dynamical organization predict task
performance. In summary, our approach distills complex brain dynamics into
interactive and behaviorally relevant representations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Amir Khan will talk about the paper &quot;Spiking Neural Networks Evolved to Perform Multiplicative Operations&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplicative or divisive changes in tuning curves of individual neurons to one stimulus (&quot;input&quot;) as another stimulus (&quot;modulation&quot;) is applied, called gain modulation, play an important role in perception and decision making. Since the presence of modulatory synaptic stimulation results in a multiplicative operation by proportionally changing the neuronal input-output relationship, such a change affects the sensitivity of the neuron but not its selectivity. Multiplicative gain modulation has commonly been studied at the level of single neurons. Much less is known about arithmetic operations at the network level. In this work we have evolved small networks of spiking neurons in which the output neurons respond to input with non-linear tuning curves that exhibit gain modulation—the best network showed an over 3-fold multiplicative response to modulation. Interestingly, we have also obtained a network with only 2 interneurons showing an over 2-fold response.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/ARRIVE-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals&quot;&gt;BMC Series&lt;/a&gt; journals, it is important that the research we consider and publish can be utilised and is trusted.  We have a responsibility to ensure that the welfare of animals has been considered and that the harm involved is justified by the expected benefit of the research. To support us, we utilise tools such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines&quot;&gt;Animal research: reporting &lt;em&gt;In Vivo &lt;/em&gt;Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the integrity and soundness of submissions that report on animal experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/&quot;&gt;NC3Rs&lt;/a&gt; developed the ARRIVE guidelines; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NC3Rs-ARRIVE-Guidelines-Checklist-fillable.pdf&quot;&gt;20 point checklist&lt;/a&gt; covering measures associated with bias (randomization, blinding, sample size calculation, data handling) with the aim to improving the quality of both scientific research design and reporting of animal studies. The guidelines prompt authors to provide sufficient detail in their research paper that would allow the reader to assess the methodological rigour of the experiment, determine the reliability of the findings, and to reproduce and build upon the work. Unfortunately, the argument for the success of ARRIVE has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197882&quot;&gt;varied&lt;/a&gt; since its launch, and despite being widely endorsed by journals, funding bodies and research institutions, the quality of reporting in animal research publications is still far from roubust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems encountered using the ARRIVE 2010 guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Editor, I have noticed that authors use the ARRIVE checklist in different ways. Given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001756&quot;&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt; adoption of ARRIVE by journals, many authors, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-10-10&quot;&gt;editors&lt;/a&gt;, are still not aware of these guidelines, or see them as an unnecessary box ticking exercise. This lack of awareness can also affect how authors plan their research where issues related to bias may not have been appropriately considered, and this has a knock-on-effect at the manuscript writing stage. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we often receive ARRIVE checklists that are incomplete or don’t correspond to what is reported in the paper. These issues could be related to language barriers or differences in research culture where authors are still not fully aware of the consequences of incomplete reporting. Alternatively, it may be related to the misconception that admitting to non-compliance of an ARRIVE item will disqualify a manuscript from being published. Overall, comparing an ARRIVE 2010 checklist against a manuscript can be an onerous task for editors and reviewers when evaluating the robustness of the methods and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;comparing an ARRIVE 2010 checklist against a manuscript can be an onerous task&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in an attempt to improve uptake, an international working group was formed to review the original ARRIVE 2010 guidelines and develop a strategy that would make ARRIVE easier for researchers, editors and reviewers to use. We are pleased to announce that the new ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines have been published today in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000410&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt; and re-published by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-020-02451-y&quot;&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARRIVE 2.0 – what has changed?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall guidelines have been simplified. Items from the original checklist have been updated and reorganised and are now presented in two categories: the ‘&lt;strong&gt;ARRIVE Essential 10&lt;/strong&gt;’ and ‘&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Set&lt;/strong&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘ARRIVE Essential 10’ is a list of key items that authors should address in their manuscript text as a minimum standard and represents best practice. If adhered to, reporting of these items should have the biggest impact on improving the quality and reliability of animal research studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second list of recommendations is designed to provide greater context and background to the study. This includes items such as conflicts of interest, protocol registration, and animal housing and welfare aspects. While not strictly essential, these points will add value to the review process, enhancing the transparency of the study design and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000411&quot;&gt;Explanation and Elaboration&lt;/a&gt; (E&amp;amp;E) document has also be made available. This helps to describe each of the ARRIVE 2.0 items in greater context and detail, and includes best practice examples from the published literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARRIVE 2.0 update joins a host of other ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021&quot;&gt;initiatives&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to address factors contributing to poor reproducibility.  There is still much work to be done to engage key stakeholders to create a process whereby these standards can be consistently implemented and enforced at the research planning stage, and then hopefully mandated by all journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12017 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/checklist-300x188.png&quot; width=&quot;318&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Kidney-blog-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number one cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease is diabetes, and the gold standard for diagnosing any kidney disease is through biopsy. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidney-biopsy&quot;&gt;kidney biopsies&lt;/a&gt; are not without risks, and although minimal, there is a risk of bleeding and damaging the kidney further by performing this invasive procedure. In addition, some patients cannot have a kidney biopsy when they truly need one because of other comorbidities, anti-coagulant medications, and other factors that make them high risk for complications. Usually for patients with diabetes that present no other concerning findings, the nephrologist might assume its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-complications/kidney-disease.html&quot;&gt;diabetic nephropathy&lt;/a&gt;, a complication of diabetes, without performing a kidney biopsy.  Could they be making a mistake?  It might be something else that is treatable.  Is there another test we could do?  What if there was an alternative for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy that is noninvasive and low risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there another test we could do?  What if there was an alternative for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy that is noninvasive and low risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;BMC Neprhology &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01902-w&quot;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;, Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, examine the potential use of specialized ultrasound – three-dimensional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound – to diagnose diabetic nephropathy.  This technology takes a large series of 2-D ultrasound images in rapid succession which are then assembled by a computer to create a 3-dimensional image. For pregnant women, a 3-D ultrasound may have been offered to you to look at your growing baby.  Contrast enhanced ultrasound uses intravenous contrast agents consisting of microbubbles/nanobubbles of gas, which oscillate creating an “echo” when exposed to ultrasound waves. This is a better alternative when a patient cannot get contrast agents for a CT or MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-12008 size-shareaholic-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Kidney-blog-1-640x452.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li and colleagues used these two technologies to examine 115 patients with diabetes and kidney disease that underwent kidney biopsy to see if they could differentiate between diabetic nephropathy from non-diabetic renal disease (i.e., IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy).  Sixty-four had diabetic nephropathy and 51 had non-diabetic renal disease. We know that diabetic nephropathy is more likely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/8/10/1718&quot;&gt;longer history of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and with other&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168822705000458&quot;&gt; microvascular complications&lt;/a&gt; (like retinopathy).  Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;’s data was consistent with these previous studies. They didn’t find any differences with contrast-enhanced ultrasound.  However, they did find that using a logistic regression model for BMI and right kidney volume was statistically significant.  They concluded that 3-D ultrasound has the potential to be an option in our arsenal for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; is one of a many researchers looking at utilizing 3-D ultrasound for diagnosing and managing kidney pathology.  Not surprisingly it’s been looked at for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29306987/&quot;&gt;determining kidney volume in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;.  And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009042951830774X&quot;&gt;Calio &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; examined 3-D contrast-enhanced ultrasound use in surveillance for renal cell carcinoma recurrence after ablation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my clinical practice, I’m not running out to get a 3-D ultrasounds just yet, but I’m keeping it in mind for the future. After further studies, I might be ordering it for that diabetic patient with chronic kidney disease to make sure I’m not missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Qzkv2xVliT0/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18267</id>
		<updated>2020-07-14T14:37:24+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Helen Sitar is the community coordinator for DORA and a Science Policy Programme Officer at&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.embo.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; EMBO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and Anna Hatch is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;’s program director. &lt;em&gt;DORA receives financial support from PLOS via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When seeking to fill an open faculty position, it’s common for universities to receive hundreds of applications for a single job. Unsurprisingly, such a high level of competition creates a bottleneck early in the hiring process. The ‘triage’ phase of review therefore becomes a critical point, as it determines which applicants receive further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ability to efficiently yet effectively triage applications has been a long-standing challenge for the academic community. Time constraints make triage prone to the influence of unintended biases and proxy measures of success, such as the journals where the candidate has published or their institutional affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, consistency between reviewers presents another challenge.  Even when selecting for the same purpose, processes and standards can vary greatly between individual reviewers or committees, due to differing assumptions about the process or the criteria for making judgments. Reviewers may prefer certain institutions, labs, or journals, or attach different values to funding track records. If reviewers are unaware of their own biases for certain community affiliations, these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/how-to-combat-bias-in-hiring/9a403c85-c162-4a28-9464-5ff2d5ea9371&quot;&gt;can influence decision-making&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, biased hiring processes impede underrepresented and minoritized scholars from making progress in their academic careers, resulting in inequalities in academic leadership and more. Without any intervention, one current model of postdoc to faculty transitions suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393&quot;&gt;faculty diversity will not increase significantly&lt;/a&gt; until 2080.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing three approaches to triage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To stimulate discussion of the challenges associated with the triage process, and to identify possible solutions, DORA organized an interactive session for the 2019 ASCB | EMBO Meeting. Through a mock-review exercise, participants worked in small groups to test different approaches to the triage process. The seventeen participantsーrepresenting different groups and career stages, including postdocs, faculty members, administrators, publishers, and staff from other non-profit initiativesーwere given the description of a faculty position to ‘hire,’ general instructions on how to conduct the triage, and a set of anonymized application materials (CVs and cover letters). Because the session was limited to 75 minutes, other application materials, including letters of reference, teaching statements, and diversity statements, were not included in our informal exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The application materials were anonymized, and the author names from the references listed in the bibliographies were also removed. A note under each reference, however, indicated the applicant’s position in the author list (e.g. “2nd author, 8 authors total”). The CVs and cover letters provided to two of the participant groups were further altered, by removing institutional names and journal titles when they were presented. One of these groups was provided with an assessment matrix to guide the evaluation of different competency areas: research, teaching and mentorship, equity and inclusion, and service to scientific or academic communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By informally experimenting with these triage approaches, our goal was to understand what information people use to make judgments during the triage phase. We were also keen to surface ideas about improving the triage process. Below we summarize the discussion and insights that emerged from our exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in a name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CVs are littered with names, including those of applicants’ advisors, collaborators, coauthors, and references, which may yield strong associations for reviewers. These names can divert the reviewer’s focus from the work presented and onto the context and community in which it has been conducted. One way that names have the potential to mislead reviewers is through ingroup favoritism, wherein reviewers may gravitate towards the individuals that present affiliations most like themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, some individuals did not notice that names had been omitted from the application materials in our exercise. And others reported that it did not negatively impede the review process. Without names, participants found they became more attentive to the remaining details. For example, one group reported paying greater attention to the institutions where candidates received their training.  But relying on the names of institutions is also problematic, because they do not speak directly to the accomplishments or contributions of an individual, which should be the focus when hiring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institution and journal prestige&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the lack of institutional and journal names in materials did not detract from the participants’ ability to understand an applicant’s profile, as long as sufficient detail on their academic record had been included. Specifically, participants were interested in knowing how an applicant had contributed to the community at large, or to their department or research group, as this is a better indicator of their skills than their institutional affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Journal names were deemed generally unnecessary as well, especially when an applicant had provided a brief 2-4 sentence explanation summarizing what an article achieved and their specific contribution. This is not the first time DORA has received this feedback; it was suggested at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/1fd1018c/research-assessment-reducing-bias-in-the-evaluation-of-researchers&quot;&gt;previous conference session in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants who saw journal names in the application materials reported that they realized they were using them as a way of evaluation; these participants proposed that their assessments might have been fairer had the journal titles been removed. However, participants still wanted access to the articles’ DOIs to make papers easier to find, read, and evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One group reported that in the absence of journal names, they paid more attention to the author order and used this to determine the importance of the applicants’ contributions to each work. But others argued that knowing the authorship order for a publication did little to indicate an applicant’s role in contributing to a paper or project, and therefore was not particularly useful information. Tools like the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://casrai.org/credit/&quot;&gt;CRediT&lt;/a&gt;) can help parse apart how an individual contributed to an article or project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Details instead of names&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem with preferring candidates with well-known labs, institutions or awards named on their CVs is that by valuing reputation, departments narrow their search for talent to within known spheres. In doing so, they will miss out on hiring great researchers who have yet to be recognized by a prestigious award or hired into a well-known lab. When personal, institution, and journal names were removed at the same time in our exercise, some participants noticed that many CVs lacked details necessary to understand applicants’ skill areas. Some such details may have been in materials, such as teaching statements or reference letters, not available for the exercise. The reaction of participants to omission of these details from applicants’ CVs and cover letters underscores the importance of communicating one’s own research interests, approach to science, unique skills, and teaching and mentoring abilities. Only with this information can reviewers accurately evaluate candidates and suitability to a particular faculty role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was some disagreement regarding the necessity of including several details common to applicant CVs, including assessing candidates based on their receipt of awards or grants. Some participants paid close attention to mentions of grants, and attributed great value to the fact that an applicant had received an independent grant. Others debated the level of confidence one should have in a person’s abilities based on their receipt of grants, as this can contribute to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect&quot;&gt;“Mathew effect”&lt;/a&gt; of people already recognized receiving further recognition because of previous awards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency is key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the triage process, it is clearly important for reviewers to be able to quickly find relevant information. The necessity of this was a major topic of discussion in our session, particularly when it came to the question of being able to compare candidates with ease. The lack of consistent organization of CVs made it complicated for participants to find the relevant information needed to make judgments of applicant’s strengths in various areas (e.g. research, teaching, leadership, inclusivity, service). Moreover, some applicants’ CVs were much longer than others, which reviewers found cumbersome as the length made finding specific pieces of information even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address the need for organized CVs, the concept of a structured narrative format was mentioned in our discussions as an option to build consistency into the triage process. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/&quot;&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2019/11/14/quality-over-quantity-how-the-dutch-research-council-is-giving-researchers-the-opportunity-to-showcase-diverse-types-of-talent/&quot;&gt;Dutch Research Council&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scicv.ch/&quot;&gt;Swiss National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; are each experimenting with standard structured narrative CV formats. So far, the Dutch Research Council has received mostly &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2020/04/14/doras-first-funder-discussion-updates-from-swiss-national-science-foundation-wellcome-trust-and-the-dutch-research-council/&quot;&gt;positive feedback&lt;/a&gt; on its new narrative. Reviewers report appreciating the added context the narrative format provides, and the Council has found that it leads to a more diverse selection of researchers. Some participants in our session, however, were skeptical of enforcing a standard template CV, noting that it could restrict creativity and limit applicants in describing work which may not fit neatly into any of the preconceived categories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardizing judgments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every reviewer has their own ‘way’ of sorting through applications, and specific criteria that they look for when deciding who to ‘keep’ or ‘eliminate’ in a triage round of review. In our session, participants using an assessment matrix advocated for a short discussion between reviewers to find a common set of standards before embarking on the triage process, as a way to increase consistent decision making and help minimize the effects of implicit bias. The Germans call this process towards reaching a collective agreement—‘&lt;em&gt;abstimmen’&lt;/em&gt;. Directly translated it means “off-voting,” or voting before one begins something. Asking reviewers to calibrate how they interpret the categories in the rubric would ideally result in more consistent assessment of all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The overarching framing for the discussion was the tension between the need for efficient, accurate assessment versus the burden of devoting attention to details in every application. While some participants stated firmly that the use of rubrics may slow down the triage process, the group generally agreed that rubrics allow for uniform standards to be applied and that consistency should be valued. Still, a few others were resistant, stating that it was not desirable to ‘over-engineer’ the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Universities and research funders are increasingly reconsidering the relevance and importance of researchers’ contributions when assessing them for hiring, promotion or funding. Across the DORA and wider research communities, there are numerous discussions on how to demonstrate the value of different contributions, whether it be via descriptive narratives, article-level metrics, teaching evaluations, or other means. The triage process is the front line to further review and consideration—and is therefore both important and influential in determining the makeup of the research community and its leadership.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scholarly community has not yet reached a consensus regarding which methods for evaluation are best suited to different purposes or situations, and many believe that there will never be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution to research evaluation. Yet demands for employment and funding continue to grow, resulting in more challenges for applicants and review committees in every selection process. And as the number of PhD graduates continues to exceed the number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/digest/nsf16300.pdf&quot;&gt;available positions in academia&lt;/a&gt;, academics can expect the triage process for applications to become ever more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instilling standards and structure into research assessment processes, especially during the triage phase of review for faculty searches, appears to be a particularly robust option for reducing bias. To achieve this, universities can ask applicants to use a structured narrative CV template. Institutions can also develop evaluation assessment matrices and have conversations amongst reviewers to set standards and identify desirable applicant qualities and characteristics. By removing journal titles and replacing them with 2-4 sentence article summaries that articulate key findings and specify the researcher’s contributions, reviewers would be provided with information better suited to judging researchers’ contributions at the triage stage. When researchers and institutions reflect on and carefully choose what types of information are used to judge scholarly contributions, evaluation processes can be brought into alignment with community values.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">“Want a Drink? Go on, you know you want to.” – Peer pressure to drink alcohol among UK adults</title>
		<link href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/07/07/want-a-drink-go-on-you-know-you-want-to-peer-pressure-to-drink-alcohol-among-uk-adults/"/>
		<id>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=11988</id>
		<updated>2020-07-07T06:35:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/alcohol-492871_640-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have probably been in situations where someone offers you an alcoholic drink and you feel like you have to drink it. Or perhaps you offer people a drink and make sure that they join in the fun. Peer pressure to drink alcohol is common in our everyday lives; from parties, your local pub, to nowadays COVID-19 pandemic friendly social distancing beers on Zoom with your mates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our systematic review of 13 qualitative research studies here are five key lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Peer pressure is not just experienced by adolescents and young people:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common perception is that peer pressure exists mainly in young people. However, peer pressure can affect people of all ages. The review found the adults often saw themselves as ‘older and wiser’ compared to when they were young. But many still experienced pressures to drink and continue drinking. Who hasn’t had the offer of ‘one for the road’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. People can feel threatened by peer pressure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer pressure experiences varied from friendly banter to aggressive forms of pressure where people felt alcohol was ‘forced on you’. Being encouraged to ‘keep up’ with others’ drinking was a common reason for drinking too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Peer pressure can have a negative impact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, to get rid of peer pressure many people gave in and drank more alcohol. They either had a drink when they didn’t want to drink, or drank more than they had intended. Drinking alcohol in response to peer pressure was seen as ‘caving in’. Most people who drank as a result of peer pressure regretted this decision later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Our wider social context matters to build and keep up peer pressure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking provided connections to other people, and those who didn’t drink were often seen as boring or outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social surroundings often influenced peer pressure to drink. Drinking was seen as ‘a sociable thing’ – as normal and helping you to fit in. For men, drinking could also be seen as a way to show their masculinity, which included ‘drinking like a man’ and choosing manly drinks.  Drinking provided connections to other people, and those who didn’t drink were often seen as boring or outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. People develop strategies to deal with peer pressure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many reported using strategies to avoid pressure. Strategies included ‘nursing your drink’, drinking alcohol-free options which mimic alcoholic in flavor and appearance, or driving their car to provide an excuse for not drinking which would usually be accepted. Some people who did not drink much alcohol ‘came out’ out about their drinking preference, but this seemed to be rare. Others selected their group of friends to make sure it included non-drinkers or those who only drank moderate amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time that you’re at a party, in the pub or having social distancing beers on Zoom, will you recognize when you are pressured to drink?

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/logo-bmcoralhealth-pr-140x90.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water fluoridation is a measure to prevent caries, a disease of significant public health importance. Caries, when not managed, result in pain and discomfort for individuals and have further implications for the health and well-being of the affected individual, such as retarded growth and development of pre-school children. The huge cost of managing caries has significant impact on the allocation of public health funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different management strategies have been employed to prevent caries. Behaviour based interventions to reduce individual’s exposure to caries’ risk factors such as a reduction in sugar consumption, have limited success. Public water fluoridation is a cost-effective approach to facilitate access of populations to systematic fluoride and, in turn, reduce caries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11995&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11995&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Water-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© samopauser / stock.adobe.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of water fluoridation is still being extensively debated globally.  First, there is contradictory evidence on its effectiveness in preventing caries and there are reported risks of adverse effects such as dental and skeletal fluorosis. There are also debates weighing up the potential health benefits in the context of ethical principles and personal liberties.  Fluoridation reduces the risk of ill health in a manner which protects the vulnerable and reduces health outcome inequality between the different socioeconomic groups. Those who oppose fluoridation do so on the grounds that it is unethical to coerce individuals to live healthy lives, and emphasises the importance of consent before any health intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the level of interest in public water fluoridation, the range and complexity of the public debate, and its implication for policy making, this Collection aims to bring together empirical research papers, and theoretical and conceptual analyses about water fluoridation and caries. The Collection will consider manuscripts on the following three themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Population level impact of the introduction or the cessation of water fluoridation on health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barriers to the implementation of fluoridation and reasons for its cessation, including the assessment and evaluation of the attitudes and knowledge of members of the public, dental professionals and policy makers on water fluoridation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical arguments for and against water fluoridation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any research you would like us to consider, please submit directly to BMC Oral Health stating in your cover letter that you wish to be considered for the Collection “Something in the Water”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the articles already published in this Collection, please visit our website: https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/Fluoride&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively you can email your pre-submission queries to Anne Menard (anne.menard@biomedcentral.com).&lt;/p&gt;

[Brain scanning is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dana.org/article/fmri-still-not-a-mind-reader/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still not a mind reader&lt;/a&gt;.] An increasing number of media reports (and scientific studies) have shined a light on this fact: the mental life of one person differs from that of another, sometimes in startling ways. It's &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; been that way, but now it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Shock of the Unknown in Aphantasia: Learning that Visual Imagery Exists&quot;&gt;out in the open&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The cat is out of the bag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ALCOj5AvBTI/XvtnS1WdygI/AAAAAAAANLE/vrJmmk8cCEoz5WUY6h-THwoe4HvOW1d8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/cat%2Bis%2Bout%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bbag.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;418&quot; data-original-width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;231&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ALCOj5AvBTI/XvtnS1WdygI/AAAAAAAANLE/vrJmmk8cCEoz5WUY6h-THwoe4HvOW1d8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/cat%2Bis%2Bout%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bbag.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reading that sentence, did you have a fleeting mental picture in your mind's eye? Maybe it was clear, maybe it was hazy. Or maybe you saw no visual image at all... if that was the case, you might have a condition known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aphantasia&lt;/a&gt;, the inability to voluntarily generate mental imagery. This is a normal variant of human experience, albeit an uncommon one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the “consequences” of having Aphantasia? You may be more likely to choose a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945220301404&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scientific or mathematical occupation&lt;/a&gt;, although artists and photographers with Aphantasia certainly exist. Aphantasia is often associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945217303568&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;(A)phantasia and severely deficient autobiographical memory: Scientific and personal perspectives&quot;&gt;poor autobiographical memory&lt;/a&gt; (diminished ability to recall the past episodes of your life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Aphantasia affect your emotional reactions to ordinary experiences like looking at pictures or reading a story? If visual imagery is important for having an affective response to the shark story, would people with Aphantasia show physiological (bodily) signs of emotion while reading? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/726844v1.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wicken and colleagues (2019)&lt;/a&gt; asked this question by comparing the skin conductance response (sweaty palms) evoked by reading vs. looking at pictures. This was a pilot study reported in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/726844v1.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; (not yet peer reviewed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If visual imagery is necessary for an affective response to evocative stories, then A-Phantasics should have diminished (or absent) skin conductance responses (SCRs) compared to Typical-Phantasics. In contrast, SCRs to unpleasant pictures should not differ between the two groups, because the picture-viewing experience doesn't require imagery. However, it's still possible that imagery-based elaboration (or verbal elaboration, for that matter) could amplify the SCR, especially since each picture was presented for 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PsrkMb454sQ/XvwLo6xfJ9I/AAAAAAAANLQ/XREQEyoVQ9QcU_QIBv9snHfFSnZr1Su2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/baseline%2Bphotos--%2Bfrightening%2Bphotos.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;458&quot; data-original-width=&quot;616&quot; height=&quot;237&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PsrkMb454sQ/XvwLo6xfJ9I/AAAAAAAANLQ/XREQEyoVQ9QcU_QIBv9snHfFSnZr1Su2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/baseline%2Bphotos--%2Bfrightening%2Bphotos.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reading condition, stories were presented as sequential short phrases (to match reading speed across subjects). The control conditions weren't well-matched, unfortunately. This was especially true for Stories, where reading the task instructions served as the neutral comparison condition (instead of reading a neutral story).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The participants were 24 individuals with intact imagery (based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aphantasia.com/vividness-of-visual-imagery-questionnaire/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217303581&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;binocular rivalry priming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scores within the typical range) and 22 self-identified Aphantasics (who were older, on average, than the control participants).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  For the Aphantasia group, seven (out of the original 29) were excluded because their VVIQ or priming scores exceeded the cut-off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Pictures (Perception) condition, the physiological response to Unpleasant vs. Neutral stimuli was not significantly different for the two groups. Incidentally speaking, the skin conductance level (SCL = SCR) was quite variable, as shown in the shaded portion of the graph below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5SPZcOuGx98/XvwQjLdsTEI/AAAAAAAANLc/i6OErZMEYt0G3O-9A8hCzQ4NDnKtxj91QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/perception%2Band%2BAphantasia_Fig%2B1D.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;324&quot; data-original-width=&quot;515&quot; height=&quot;251&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5SPZcOuGx98/XvwQjLdsTEI/AAAAAAAANLc/i6OErZMEYt0G3O-9A8hCzQ4NDnKtxj91QCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/perception%2Band%2BAphantasia_Fig%2B1D.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adapted from Fig. 1D (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/726844v1.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wicken et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;).  Left:&lt;/b&gt; Aggregated progressions of baseline-corrected SCL across the duration of the frightening photos sequence (sampled as average across 5 sec time bins). &lt;b&gt;Right:&lt;/b&gt; Mean and standard error across time bins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stories were another story...

Nonetheless, this is an intriguing finding, with additional evidence forthcoming (or so I imagine)... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; See: &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/07/is-there-objective-test-for-aphantasia.html&quot;&gt;Is there an objective test for Aphantasia?&lt;/a&gt; Binocular rivalry priming can be a useful “objective” measure of aphantasia (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217303581&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Keogh &amp;amp; Pearson, 2018&lt;/a&gt;), but it's not necessarily diagnostic at an individual level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Mean age = 33.7 yrs for Aphantasia, mean = 23.0 for controls.

Trauma survivors with PTSD are haunted by these experiences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; impacting everything from sleep to relationships.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Are p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;eople with PTSD violent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Traumatic experiences sometimes include exposure to physical violence and many trauma survivors have histories that include violence even if their target trauma does not. Sadly, violence is much too common.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;ost people with PTSD are not violent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Most&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; people with PTSD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;do not have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; problems with aggression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; or violence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;. When PTSD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;happens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; with alcohol or substance misuse, the risk for violence increases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;PTSD only be managed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;not really treated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;ffective treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; for PTSD exist and include psychotherapy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;as well as medication. While these options do not work for all people suffering with PTSD, most people will see reduction in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;symptoms,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; and many will even see remission of PTSD over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.  If someone has mental health problems after a trauma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;always &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;PTSD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;PTSD is just one possible mental health problem that can occur following trauma. Since PTSD involves being haunted by a trauma memory, it is easily connected to a traumatic event. However, studies following people after exposure to trauma show that for some people trauma may result in other issues, such as depression, panic disorder, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;substance abuse, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;or even obsessive-compulsive disorder.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Pride parade&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Pride-parade-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride Month is celebrated around the world in June to commemorate the 1969 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/stonewall-uprising-50-years-lgbt-history&quot;&gt;Stonewall Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. Pride is both a celebration and a protest and encourages acceptance, solidarity, and visibility of LGBTQ2S+ people and their rights, including their right to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the general population, it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/lgbthealth/about.htm&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; internationally that LGBTQ2S+ people experience poorer health outcomes, both psychologically and physically. These poorer health outcomes are a consequence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/jhdrp/vol2/iss2/6/&quot;&gt;healthcare disparities&lt;/a&gt;. That is, LGBTQ2S+ individuals face unequal burdens in healthcare which increases the incidence, or prevalence, of poorer health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a vicious circle that continues due to the lack of attention on the poorer health outcomes and underserved healthcare needs that LGBTQ2S+ people experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthcare settings, LGBTQ2S+ people are more likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303049&quot;&gt;not receive appropriate healthcare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbtq-rights/news/2018/01/18/445130/discrimination-prevents-lgbtq-people-accessing-health-care/&quot;&gt;experience discrimination and harassment&lt;/a&gt;. Barriers to accessing healthcare bring harmful experiences for LGBTQ2S+ people. These experiences can have detrimental effects, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146139&quot;&gt;decreasing the likelihood&lt;/a&gt; of seeking healthcare in the future, consequently leading to poorer health outcomes. This is a vicious circle that continues due to the lack of attention on the poorer health outcomes and underserved healthcare needs that LGBTQ2S+ people experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are some of the common barriers in LGBTQ2S+ healthcare?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Barrier &quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-11982 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/barrier-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple unsolved barriers for LGBTQ2S+ people to access healthcare and here we touch on some examples. It is especially important to acknowledge that these barriers can be further exacerbated by a number of factors, including the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/how-covid-19-affecting-lgbt-communities&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, where, as an example, transgender people have been found to face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(20)30182-0/fulltext&quot;&gt;unprecedented and enlarged healthcare disparities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there are limited numbers of healthcare staff trained to deliver healthcare that recognizes the needs of the LGBTQ2S+ people. Considering the risks of facing discrimination, LGBTQ2S+ people &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08834-y&quot;&gt;could hesitate&lt;/a&gt; to disclose information such as sexual orientation and how they identity to healthcare staff. This makes it difficult for healthcare personnel to appreciate the specific needs of the patient and to provide the most appropriate and holistic care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, The LGBTQ2S+ community continues to face severe inequalities in their access and provision of care, which is closely linked to governmental policy. Most recently, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/health/trump-health-care-transgender-rights.html&quot;&gt;revised US Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt; has narrowed the definition of sex discrimination to the extent that it omits protections for transgender people in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, LGBTQ2S+ people can also experience discrimination and harassment in the workplace. LGBTQ2S+ people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223372&quot;&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a lower income, which can be a financial pressure and barrier to LGBTQ2S+ people accessing and using health services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can we remove the barriers in the future?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Removing Barriers&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-11983 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Removing-Barriers-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have previously presented an LGBTQ2S+ &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-57192-008.html&quot;&gt;Health Equity Promotion Model&lt;/a&gt;, guiding LGBTQ2S+ people to consider both positive and negative health-related circumstances to reach full psychological and physical health potentials. But more research and work is needed to involve LGBTQ2S+ people in guiding the research agenda to promote the recognition of specific healthcare needs, whilst respecting the differences amongst the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant efforts need to be made to reduce health disparities and remove barriers to healthcare. Society should work together to promote healthcare equity, address and prevent LGBTQ2S+ poorer health outcomes, support LGBTQ2S+ people to access safe and inclusive healthcare, and work to eliminate healthcare disparities. It is essential to translate negative research findings in this context into reformative and progressive practices.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;CBD is one of a class of compounds known as cannabinoids, which are found in the cannabis plant. Unlike THC (the main psychoactive component of cannabis), CBD is not thought to have intoxicating effects. It is, however, believed to interact with the nervous system. In this video, I discuss what we know about CBD’s mechanism of action and its potential in treating various conditions like epilepsy and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuroscientificallychallenged/neurochallenged/~4/V0ASzf9MLnY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>
