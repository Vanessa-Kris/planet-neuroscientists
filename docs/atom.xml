 Earlier this year, Justin Pickett, a criminologist at the University of Albany at the State University of New York, asked journals to look into potentially problematic data in five papers — including one on which he had been a co-author.  As we reported in July, Pickett’s request came after he’d received an anonymous email pointing … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/09/06/criminology-saga-leads-to-an-expression-of-concern-and-a-correction/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Criminology saga leads to an expression of concern, and a correction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn on the news tonight and you’ll be bombarded with gloomy stories. You’ll hear about disasters and human suffering, political scandals and environmental destruction. Maybe there will be some good news sandwiched in there — a piece on an exciting new scientific discovery, perhaps, or a profile of a talented young musician. But overall, news coverage is predominantly negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that the case? Ultimately, of course, journalists decide what stories and issues receive coverage. But they are also catering to the demands of their audience — and it seems that we respond most to negative stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all of us. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/08/27/1908369116&quot;&gt;recent international study in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looking at people’s physiological responses to news reports has found that &lt;em&gt;overall&lt;/em&gt; we do seem to have greater reactions to negative stories. However, there is so much variation in how different people respond, say the researchers, that there may be a bigger market for positive stories than journalists often realise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37766&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies into people’s “negativity bias” when consuming media have largely focussed on Anglo-American participants. So Stuart Soroka from the University of Michigan and colleagues set about investigating whether this bias was a universal phenomenon, or specific to certain cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 1,156 participants from 17 countries around the world — from Ghana to Sweden to Chile — to watch a series of BBC News stories. Each participant saw five international clips consisting of a mixture of positive news (e.g. a report on a zoo releasing gorillas back into the wild) and negative news (e.g. a clip on a UN war crimes investigation). Participants also saw one positive and one negative news story local to their country (my personal favourite was a good news story seen by New Zealand participants about a local group that teaches dogs to drive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also measured participants’ heart rate variability and skin conductance while they watched the clips. These physiological measures are related to arousal and attentiveness, and can provide a record of people’s reactions in real time, without them needing to make any conscious response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, heart rate variability and skin conductance were greater when participants were watching the negative clips than when they were watching the positive ones. This suggests that the negativity bias is a global phenomenon, say the authors. “This study directly demonstrates that humans around the world are more activated by negative news coverage,” they write. “We are, perhaps, one step closer to accounting for the high frequency of negative news content around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that wasn’t the whole story. From this data, the researchers then modelled how each individual’s heart rate variability and skin conductance would change as a clip became more negative in tone. While these physiological measures increased for the majority of people, there was a huge amount of variation — many participants actually showed no change or a decreased response. The differences between participants didn’t seem to strongly relate to the country they lived in, suggesting that they couldn’t simply be explained by cultural factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that if the media want to attract audiences, they don’t necessarily need to only show negative content, say the authors.  “Even as the average tendency may be for viewers to be more attentive to and aroused by negative content, there would appear to be a good number of individuals with rather different or perhaps more mutable preferences,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, physiological recordings are just one way of measuring how engaged someone is, and it would be interesting to see if the results line up with more explicit measures of engagement with the news, such as surveys or interviews about people’s preferences. Still, it seems as good a time as any to inject a bit more positivity into our news coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/08/27/1908369116&quot;&gt;Cross-national evidence of a negativity bias in psychophysiological reactions to news&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extraversion, thy name is Katie. And Jack. And Carter. But not, it turns out, Joanna, Owen, or Lauren: these individuals instead embody different traits, like emotionality and agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-43758-001&quot;&gt;how people rated the personalities of those names&lt;/a&gt; in a recent paper published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;. According to the study, we associate the sounds in names with certain traits: names containing &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; sounds are judged as having quite different profiles than those with the more resonant &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;l&lt;/em&gt; sounds. It will come as no surprise, however, that in the real world Katies are not actually any more likely to be extraverted than Laurens. &lt;span id=&quot;more-37747&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past studies have found that people tend to associate particular sounds with certain shapes: the word “bouba” with a round shape and “kiki” with a spiky one, for example. And we &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/28/heres-why-spiky-shapes-seem-angry-and-round-sounds-are-calming/&quot;&gt;may also instinctively associate shapes and sounds with particular emotional states&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But David Sidhu and colleagues at the University of Calgary were interested in whether people relate sounds to more abstract concepts, like personalities. In particular, the team wanted to know whether we judge people’s personalities differently depending on whether their names contain “sonorants” — resonant or nasal sounds like &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;l&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; — or “voiceless stops” — short sounds that are formed by blocking air flow in the vocal tract, such as &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across three studies, the team showed a total of 180 participants a series of traits that reflect different aspects of personality like conscientiousness (e.g. “hard-working”) or extraversion (e.g. “social”). At the same time, they displayed names that contained either sonorants (e.g. “Lauren”) or voiceless stops (e.g. “Katie”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one study, participants saw a pair of names, and had to pick which one best matched a given trait, while in another they saw a single name, and had to rate how well the trait described that person. In a third study, participants rated the personalities of made-up names with similar sounds: “Mauren” instead of Lauren; “Tatie” instead of Katie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three studies, participants rated sonorant names like Lauren higher on agreeableness, and in two of the studies they also rated them higher in emotionality and conscientiousness. In contrast, voiceless stop names like Katie were rated higher in extraversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would people rate certain names as being more extraverted or more agreeable? Perhaps, reasoned the researchers, in the real world people’s names truly do reflect their personalities. So in another study, they asked more than 1,000 participants to complete online personality surveys — but found no real evidence for a link between the participants’ personalities and the sounds in their own names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that people have already made associations between particular names and traits: perhaps they have a particularly agreeable friend called Lauren, for example. But the fact that the researchers saw the same effects even for made-up names suggests that this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers suggest, &lt;span&gt;we may have learned to associate certain sounds with particular emotional contexts. For example, people may tend to use softer, sonorant sounds in calmer situations, and so we perceive those with sonorant sounds in their names — the Laurens and the Owens — as more agreeable and conscientious. Alternatively, the relationship between sound and personality could be more metaphorical: the short abrupt sounds in “Jack” and “Katie”, for instance, might bring to mind the quick, bouncy energy of someone with a more extraverted personality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, it seems unlikely that the information gleaned from the sounds in a name will have much impact on how we judge a person in the real world, where we usually have a lot of other information about them. But knowing how a sound brings to mind other characteristics could be useful in some situations. A company naming its product probably should consider whether the sounds in the name will affect people’s perceptions, suggest the researchers, while an author might want to give their protagonist a name that fits their personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;How do you persuade people to do the “right thing” when there’s a personal price to pay? What convinces someone to spend time and effort on a task like recycling batteries, for example — or literally spend cash by giving to people in desperate need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an important question. “Finding mechanisms to promote pro-social behaviour is fundamental for the wellbeing of our societies and is more urgent than ever in a time of key global challenges such as resource conservation, climate change and social inequalities,” write the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48094-4&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. Across a series of five online studies involving a total of more than 3,000 participants, Valerio Capraro at Middlesex University of London and colleagues provide evidence for a cheap, effective method: simply “nudging” people to reflect on what is the morally right thing to do. This simple intervention had some impressive effects, even increasing actual charitable donations by close to half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37738&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The first study involved a simple test of altruistic behaviour. The researchers gave US-based participants 20 cents each and told them they were paired with someone else who had nothing. Right before being told that they could donate any part of that 20 cent pot to their (fictional) partner, one group was asked, “What do you personally think is the morally right thing to do in this situation?” Another was asked, “What do you think your society considers to be the morally right thing to do in this situation?” The third was simply asked how much they wanted to donate. This group donated, on average, 21.2% of their money, while members of both the ‘moral nudge’ groups donated an average of 30.6%. (Statistically, both nudges were equally effective.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In further studies, the team found that the effect of giving moral nudges in this altruism task also “spilled over” to increase later cooperative behaviour, explored using an economic version of the classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://policonomics.com/lp-game-theory2-prisoners-dilemma/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink0&quot;&gt;prisoner’s dilemma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;For the final study, 1,662 participants were given 50 cents and asked if they wanted to donate all or part to either &lt;em&gt;Emergency&lt;/em&gt;, a humanitarian NGO that provides emergency medical treatment to victims of war, or &lt;em&gt;Give for France&lt;/em&gt;, an organisation supporting victims of the July 14, 2016 Nice terrorist attack. (These experiments were conducted within a few days of this attack.) Morally-nudged participants gave 47% more to &lt;em&gt;Give for France&lt;/em&gt;, and 39% more to &lt;em&gt;Emergency, &lt;/em&gt;than those who hadn’t been given a moral prompt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, this combined average increase in actual charitable donations of 44% is very similar to the 47% increase observed when people who donated to a fund-raiser were &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/121/2/747/1884044?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;entered into a lottery to win a cash prize&lt;/a&gt;. “Moral nudges produce…essentially the same increase but are free of cost,” Capraro and his colleagues note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that their results could potentially influence policy aimed at increasing pro-social behaviour. However, as they also note, it’s early days for this research, and there are still questions. Would moral nudges increase pro-social behaviour in other spheres of life, beyond small-scale crowdsourced charitable giving? And what underpins the increase in pro-social behaviour: did the moral nudges work because participants sincerely wanted to do the morally right thing, or because they felt that such behaviour was appropriate in the context of these experiments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach certainly seems promising. Now, &lt;span&gt;the team writes, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“future research should explore potential generalisations, with a particular focus to larger stakes, longer time spans and a greater number of interactions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48094-4.pdf&quot;&gt;Increasing altruistic and cooperative behaviour with simple moral nudges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering into a new intimate relationship can feel exciting and full of possibility. And for many, it may seem to offer the chance to escape the patterns of our previous relationships: perhaps there will be less arguing, or maybe the new relationship will provide a greater sense of satisfaction. But a recent study suggests that once the initial honeymoon period is over, the dynamics of a new relationship may end up being pretty similar to the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37732&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the kinds of changes that occur when people move from one partner to the next, Matthew Johnson from the University of Alberta and Franz Neyer from Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena examined data from the German Family Panel, a longitudinal study that has been following more than 12,000 people since 2008. Each year, participants complete a survey that includes rating their relationship and sexual satisfaction, frequency of sex, relationship stability, and how much they quarrel with their partner or receive admiration from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ffam0000523&quot;&gt;their new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Family Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, the team analysed the responses of 554 participants who had had two intimate relationships which had both lasted long enough to be recorded in two surveys. This provided the team with data from the second-to-last and final year of one relationship, and the first and second year of the subsequent relationship. By comparing the levels of satisfaction, instability and so on at these different stages, they could see how dynamics changed across relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair found that at the end of the first relationship, all of the measures deteriorated: people became less satisfied, argued more and so on. Unsurprisingly, these measures then all improved when they began seeing their next partner. A year later, however, they dropped again — the “honeymoon” period had worn off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the researchers compared the first survey of the first relationship and the second survey of the second relationship — that is, the most stable phases in the partnerships — the responses were pretty similar. There were no significant differences in sexual or relationship satisfaction, in the amount of conflict, or in perceptions of stability. Only two measures differed: overall, participants had more sex and received more admiration from their partner in the second relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that our intimate partnerships end up quite similar to the ones that came before them. We may feel like a new partnership is different or better, the researchers say, because the conflict and negative feelings that characterise the end of a previous relationship “cast a long shadow over the memory of that union”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a lack of evidence for differences between relationships doesn’t necessarily mean that such changes don’t occur. Of particular concern is that the study used very basic survey measures: most involved just one or two questions (e.g. “All in all, how satisfied are you with your relationship?”), so may not have been sensitive to more subtle changes in dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as the researchers point out, even if &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt; people don’t see many differences between their relationships, there might be certain individual characteristics that make changes more or less likely. For instance, the team found that participants’ level of neuroticism and relationship length both influenced the pattern of results. “Changes did occur for some people,” they conclude, “but despite the presence of a new partner, change is not inevitable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ffam0000523&quot;&gt; (Eventual) stability and change across partnerships.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Having an MRI scan can be a noisy, unusual, and sometimes stressful experience. But can it also be a social one?







In a new paper, neuroscientists Benjamin O. Turner and colleagues ask whether telling people that their MRI scan will be a &quot;mind reading&quot; procedure is enough to alter brain activity through 'implied social presence'. As the authors put it:



If people believe that a technology can ‘see’ their internal thoughts, will people alter what they think about?

&lt;p&gt;Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory condition, which affects the skin’s surface. The condition causes inflamed, red, flaky and itchy skin, often around the knees, elbows and scalp.  The condition is believed to affect &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psoriasis.org/about-psoriasis&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1 in 50 people,&lt;/a&gt; affecting all ages, races and genders. A large percentage of people are diagnosed below the age of 35. Currently, it is thought that psoriasis affects roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/204417/9789241565189_eng.pdf.psoriasis;jsessionid=54912784D28C9F36ECCD45471AC5775B?sequence=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;100 million people worldwide,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epiomic.com/epidemiology-databases/epiomic-segmentation/diseases/psoriasis?category=254&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1.6 million in the UK and nearly 7.6 million Americans&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt; making p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;soriasis a global problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11215&quot; style=&quot;width: 210px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11215 size-bones-thumb-200&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/psoriasis-1-200x140.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Psoriasis is known for causing often dry and painful skin&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psoriasis lesions are often located in areas of the body that are visible to other people. Despite being fairly common, there are often misconceptions that the condition may be contagious and is known to affect people’s self-esteem.  Since the condition is chronic, this can negatively impact the mental health of people experiencing the condition. The National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psoriasis.org/life-with-psoriasis/depression&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;notes that&lt;/a&gt; depression is the number one comorbidity of psoriasis. People with psoriasis are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psoriasis.org/life-with-psoriasis/depression&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;twice as likely to become depressed&lt;/a&gt; as the rest of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11223&quot; style=&quot;width: 141px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11223 size-full&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/psroasisi-3.png&quot; width=&quot;131&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Kim Kardashian has previously spoken out about her experience of psoriasis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;In popular culture, businesswoman and television personality, Kim Kardashian, has recently announced she experiences the condition. Given Kardashian’s huge social media following, it is possible that this could help to bring awareness to the condition and comfort and understanding to those who also experience psoriasis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;What do we know about psoriasis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psoriasis.org/life-with-psoriasis/depression&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;notes that&lt;/a&gt; depression is the number one co-morbidity of psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although psoriasis is common, the condition is under-researched. The underlying cause of psoriasis is thought to be our immune system unnecessarily accelerating the growth of skin cells resulting in inflammation. It is thought that combinations of genes as well as exposure to particular external factors are likely to trigger development of the condition. Scientists have now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5751129/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;identified about 25 genetic variants,&lt;/a&gt; which increase the probability of a person developing psoriasis. The most common form of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis, is thought to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3376640/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;caused by a rare genetic mutation&lt;/a&gt; known as CARD14. Stress, weather changes, medications, infections, skin trauma, smoking and alcohol are all thought to flare up the condition. Most people experience small lesions, however, severity varies on a case-by-case basis. The condition is split into six main types; plaque psoriasis, scalp psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, psoriasis in sensitive areas and nail psoriasis (summarized in table 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;123&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plaque Psoriasis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;Whole body&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;The most common type of psoriasis. Caused by a build-up of skin cells known as ‘plaques’.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;123&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalp Psoriasis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;Scalp&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;May result in dandruff like flakes and in extreme cases cause thinning of the hair.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;123&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guttate Psoriasis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;Torso back and limbs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;Also known as ‘tear drop’ psoriasis due to the shape of the spots that are often bright pink or red on the skin.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;123&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pustular Psoriasis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;Whole body&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;Results in small white or yellow blisters on top of red or darkened skin. The blisters are often filled with fluid giving them a yellow colour.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;123&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psoriasis in Sensitive Areas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;Face, armpits genitals and skin folds.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;Skin is more sensitive in particular areas, especially around skin folds / clothing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;123&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nail Psoriasis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;Nails&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;Often affects the nails or toenails and can be painful, restricting movement.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1: &lt;/strong&gt;Summary of the different types of psoriasis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;Despite being fairly common, there are often misconceptions that the condition may be contagious and is known to affect people’s self-esteem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The severity of the condition is assessed by the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) scale, which is a 6-point, 0-5 measure of psoriasis based on different symptoms, across the whole body. It is used to standardize the diagnosis of psoriasis, particularly in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcdermatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12895-019-0088-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A recent article&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Dermatology&lt;/em&gt; collected data from 3641 patients suffering with moderate, severe and chronic psoriasis. A version of the PGA scale was applied to participants in a clinical trial setting, to test its validity. The study provided an ‘intensive and rigorous’ analysis of the scoring matrix. It concluded that the scale is reliable to obtain a global assessment on the severity of psoriasis, further validating the three-item PGA tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What treatments are available? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no permanent treatment available for psoriasis. Initially, treatment often involves topical creams applied to the skin to help relieve the symptoms of the condition. Treatments vary on the type and severity of psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are working on new treatments for the management of the condition. This includes the use of a therapeutic antibody, or monoclonal antibody, called Secukinumab. Two proteins involved in human immune responses, Interleukins 12 and 23, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17706835&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have been suggested&lt;/a&gt; to play a role in the development of psoriasis. Therefore, researchers have developed a human monoclonal antibody to disable these proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcdermatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12895-019-0087-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study protocol&lt;/a&gt; recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Dermatology&lt;/em&gt; lays out the plans to assess the real world safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in the management of moderate to severe psoriasis through a multinational study. Previous controlled clinical trials have shown secukinumab to be safe and effective and the results of this up-and-coming trial hope to highlight the real world, long term benefits of secukinumab, in turn improving quality of life in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;arXiv is an important component of scholarly communication among its communities. The readers and authors of arXiv expect to find articles that advance their scientific understanding and pique ideas and discussions, and so arXiv maintains that expectation and trust with assistance from its moderation process. The arXiv moderation process strives to rapidly disseminate research while meeting content and technical standards.  Each paper that an author submits is subject to this process, which checks that submissions are relevant to the scientific community and follow arXiv policies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This year, on average, over 10,000 articles were submitted to one of the 8 scientific categories and their 149 total sub-categories within arXiv each month. This means that every day 600-800 articles are submitted by authors who expect that their article will be posted in the next announcement. We manage this volume with a team of arXiv administrators and volunteer moderators who work together to verify that submissions meet our technical requirements and content policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What is our moderation process?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_488&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2019/08/Moderation-Process-visual.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Moderation illustrated as a net or web for submissions to pass through to being a posted arXiv paper&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-488 size-full&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; id=&quot;longdesc-return-488&quot; longdesc=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv?longdesc=488&amp;amp;referrer=486&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2019/08/Moderation-Process-visual.jpg&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The moderation process serves as a net to capture submissions for review of category assignment, technical requirements, and appropriate content before being posted to arXiv.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;arXiv administrators, consisting of a small team of staff and students, work with 170+ volunteer moderators to review the classification, metadata, and content of all submissions. The team performs checks with software support to confirm that the submission is classified to the appropriate subject category, that it is in compliance with our technical requirements, including formatting and metadata information, and that the content is appropriate, which, generally, describes content that would be refereeable by a conventional journal and in the format of a research article. Our arXiv administrators and volunteer moderators work together to review submissions and resolve any issues to move the submission to announcement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The arXiv moderation process is not a peer-review process. arXiv staff and moderators do not evaluate the validity of the scientific process and cannot give feedback on the submission. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;arXiv administrators and moderators work under the guidance and policies set by the arXiv Scientific Director, with advice from our Scientific Advisory Board and the Subject Advisory Committees. The Chair of the Subject Advisory Committees and Scientific Director help administrators and moderators resolve questions and issues when requested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Approximately 15% of daily submissions are flagged for additional actions or review. Submissions that were not flagged for review or were resolved before the deadline are posted to the next announcement. Our goal is to resolve issues within 24 hours, but some decisions require more time; thus, the submission is placed on hold until a decision can be reached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As we balance our goals of rapid distribution with our moderation standards, sometimes content gets posted that maybe should not have been accepted. As arXiv is a permanent repository, these submissions cannot be removed after they are posted. Only in cases where the submitter did not have the legal right to submit content to arXiv do we consider removal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Who are our moderators?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Moderators are volunteers from around the world who have been successfully selected by the Subject Advisory Committee, based on their expertise in their professional fields and in their subject classifications. Our moderators evaluate submissions based on the content and the policies of arXiv, and work with the arXiv administrative staff. They are each responsible for the submissions to their assigned sub-category, and work, ideally, with at least one other moderator. Although, some categories have only one moderator. Moderators generally spend less than 30 mins each day resolving flagged submissions before the day’s deadline, which is 14:00 Eastern Time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We depend on our moderators. They keep arXiv relevant and of interest to professional researchers– we could not do it without them! Like many organizations that rely on devoted individuals contributing their time and effort, we could not provide the service the arXiv community expects without their dedicated volunteer service. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Thank you, moderators!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co&lt;em&gt;rrection: the original post was clarified to explain that moderators cannot not give feedback on submissions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The Journal of Biological Chemistry has retracted three papers by a group from the University of California, Los Angeles, citing problems with the figures.  Two of the papers, published in 2002, 2004 and 2009, have the same last author, Mark H. Doolittle, who is the first author of the most recent article.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/pregnant-shot-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge of high-quality respectful care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, many childbearing women have &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0959-353505054718&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;little opportunity&lt;/a&gt; to make autonomous childbirth decisions themselves and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/AMR51/007/2010/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/10/07/no-tally-anguish/accountability-maternal-health-care-india&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;poor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-5-140&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;care&lt;/a&gt;. This relates to the general status of women in society, and more specifically to the failure of maternity services to produce optimal and dignified care for all. The latter is an issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001847&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported in&lt;/a&gt; high-income countries as well as low- and middle-income countries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.13179&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6963-13-166&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers are the vital link between evidence-based policies and women receiving high-quality respectful maternity care. &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-015-0117-9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Explanations&lt;/a&gt; in the literature for suboptimal care often include poor working conditions for staff and a lack of essential supplies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/134588/WHO_RHR_14.23_eng.pdf;jsessionid=F37EF1B2368143CB93A6557A92CF6F3C?sequence=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-14-268&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;explanations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871519212000352?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that doctors, midwives and care assistants might lack vital skills or be unaware of the rights of the women for whom they care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2420-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Our study&lt;/a&gt; examined the everyday lives of maternal healthcare providers working in a tertiary maternity hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, between 2010 and 2012. The aim was to understand the staff’s notions of care, their varying levels of commitment to providing care for women in childbirth, and the obstacles and dilemmas that affected standards, and thereby gain insight into their contributions to respectful maternity care, whether as ‘villains’ or as ‘victims.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11230&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11230 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/Busy-Kabul-street-1-300x225.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;credit: author&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We employed an ethnographic approach to qualitatively explore the culture of care. Dr. Arnold spent six weeks observing care and interacting with staff. She then conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with doctors, midwives and care assistants, as well as 41 background interviews. In addition, focus groups were held with two diverse groups of women in community settings to understand their experiences and how they wished to be cared for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key findings of this paper are that women related many instances of neglect, verbal abuse and demands for bribes from staff. Doctors and midwives concurred that they did not provide care as they had been taught and blamed the workload, lack of a shift system, insufficient supplies, and inadequate support from management. Closer inspection revealed a complex reality where care was impeded by low levels of supplies and medicines, caused by supply shortages and further reduced by theft; where some staff were unfairly blamed by management but others flouted rules with impunity; and where motivated staff tried hard to work well but, when overwhelmed with the workload, admitted that they lost patience and shouted at women in childbirth. In addition, there were extreme examples of both abusive and vulnerable staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that providing respectful, quality maternity care for women in Afghanistan requires multifaceted initiatives because the factors leading to suboptimal care or mistreatment are complex and interrelated. Standards need to be enforced and abusive practices need to be confronted in order to provide a supportive, facilitating environment for both staff and birthing women. Polarized perspectives such as ‘villain’ or ‘victim’ are unhelpful as they exclude the complex realities of human behavior and consequently limit the scope of problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long known that people who are more extraverted tend to be happier, leading some to suggest that encouraging extraverted behaviour could improve wellbeing. Last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/24/first-trial-of-an-act-like-an-extravert-intervention-finds-that-it-comes-with-drawbacks-for-introverts/&quot;&gt;we reported on the first trial&lt;/a&gt; of such an intervention, which found that acting like an extravert for a week led to an increase in positive emotions in certain people. Now a second study appears to have replicated that result — and shown that behaving like an introvert may also &lt;em&gt;reduce &lt;/em&gt;wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37708&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xge0000668&quot;&gt;the new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, &lt;/em&gt;Seth Margolis and Sonja Lyubomirsky at the University of California, Riverside, asked 131 participants to alter their behaviour over a two week period to be more extraverted or introverted. For one week, participants were encouraged to act as “talkative”, “assertive” and “spontaneous” as possible; for the other, they were told to act “deliberate”, “quiet” and “reserved” (all participants completed both weeks, but half began with the extraverted week while the others began with with the introverted week).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To encourage the participants to actually alter their behaviour, the researchers asked them to list five specific changes they planned on making, and then sent them periodic reminders of their task throughout the study.  A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;t various points across the two weeks, the participants &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;completed scales measuring their experience of positive and negative emotions and others aspects of wellbeing, as well as their personality traits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to baseline levels at the start of the study, participants experienced more positive emotions during the extraverted week — and also showed reduced positive emotions during the introverted week. Some other measures of wellbeing, such as feelings of connectedness and flow (the experience of being immersed in — and enjoying — an activity) were also boosted by acting extraverted and reduced by acting introverted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these results didn’t hold for all measures of wellbeing. For instance, participants seemed to have reduced negative emotions compared to baseline during both interventions (although the exact pattern of results differed depending on whether participants began with the extraverted or introverted week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results add to the small, albeit growing, body of evidence that acting like an extravert can improve certain aspects of wellbeing — particularly measures of positive emotion. But the authors suggest that their biggest contribution is to show that acting like an introvert can also have an effect. “Given that introversion is generally not regarded as desirable or advantageous in U.S. culture … we believe our most compelling results are those showing that well-being decreases can be substantial when people act more introverted than usual,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it seems too soon to suggest that we should we all begin behaving like extraverts. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/8ze6w/&quot;&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;the Digest &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/24/first-trial-of-an-act-like-an-extravert-intervention-finds-that-it-comes-with-drawbacks-for-introverts/&quot;&gt;reported on&lt;/a&gt; last year found that people who had high trait levels of introversion didn’t report the same benefits of acting like an extravert as the rest of the participants, and actually became more fatigued and experienced more negative emotions. On the other hand, the new paper found that baseline levels of extraversion and introversion didn’t affect the results – but it’s still clear that researchers need a better understanding of how individual differences could influence the effectiveness of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it will also be important to figure out which behaviours are actually causing the increases or decreases in wellbeing reported in these studies. It’s not yet clear whether it was being more “talkative”, “assertive”, or “spontaneous” that resulted in an increase in wellbeing in the extraverted week, for instance, and the researchers suggest examining changes in a more specific sub-set of extraverted behaviours in the future. “We hope that research from our and others’ laboratories encourages future investigators to test the potential of behavioral interventions to spur both personality change and well-being gains,” they conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000668&quot;&gt;Experimental manipulation of extraverted and introverted behavior and its effects on well-being&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Stop by booth B550 to say hello. Dr. Bando is also attending ESC. Below is a brief, unedited interview with her. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am senior lecturer &amp;amp; PI who works at Cardiology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. Targeting translational science in cardiovascular medicine, our team is enjoying and struggling with basic and clinical research.  Also, I am committee member of Japanese Circulation Society and International Society of Heart Research etc and dedicate myself to facilitating diversity and inclusion activities to share opportunity and social networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How long have you been an academic editor for PLOS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years, indeed. Time flies so fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What is your specific area of study and why is it important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary expertise is diabetic cardiomyopathy and diastolic heart failure at benchside. Recently, due to growing needs at bedside, we generate new team that focuses clinical research regarding onco-cardiology (cardio-oncology in US). Interestingly, I have noticed that my research experience on diabetic cardiomyopathy does seem to be applicable for those onco-cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What first drew you into the field?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was medical student, I had started my scientific experience to explore the regulatory role of protein kinase C in calponin, a calcium-regulatory protein in smooth muscle contraction. That was pretty good start and this experience attracted me so much and I decide to dive deeply into basic science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are there any trends in your field right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic remodeling and the role of mitochondria. Mitochondria is a mystery and gem of cardiovascular research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Why do you believe in Open Science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because open science contributes to enhance data reliability, feasibility, and popularity. Fortunately, the modern era of digital and network facilitates open science in easier and faster way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What are you most looking forward to at ESC this year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late breaking clinical science (Hot line). Plus, visit Foujita chapel at Reims, if I may have any chance to make small trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Picture yourself sitting in a Zen garden, surrounded by low, rounded bushes and gravel raked into rippling swirls. Now imagine standing in front of a brutalist building, all straight lines and sharp edges. If you think you’d feel more relaxed in the Zen garden, there could be a low-level perceptual reason — one that could explain everything from why you’re far more likely to find a jagged script on the cover of a death metal album than on a romance novel, to why clouds and lullabies seem to go together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.0513&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink0&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&lt;/i&gt;, suggests that we automatically associate variations in one particular property of images or sounds with variations in levels of emotional arousal. This gives us an instinctive understanding, just from the tone of someone’s voice or watching their movements, of whether they are angry or sad, excited or calm. But it seems that these associations between perception and emotion are so automatic and fundamental that we apply them to inanimate objects, as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37691&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beau Sievers at Harvard University and colleagues ran a series of five studies designed to explore this property, known as the “spectral centroid”. Images and sounds can be decomposed into a spectrum that contains many components of different frequencies. Those components will differ depending on the shape or sound: a smooth curve, for example, is made up of lower frequencies than a shape with lots of straight lines and corners. The spectral centroid (SC) is essentially the average of this frequency spectrum. Sievers’ team wanted to know whether this property was related to levels of emotional arousal, with anger and excitement, for example, being characterised by high levels of arousal and feeling sad or peaceful by low levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In one study, the researchers asked participants to match hundreds of randomly-generated shapes and sounds to feeling angry, excited sad or peaceful. Shapes with lots of corners and sharp angles had high SCs and were also far more likely to be matched to anger and excitement. The same was true for high SC sounds characterised by brief bursts of white noise. In contrast, blobby, swirly shapes and more ‘rounded’ sounds had low SCs, and were predominantly paired with being peaceful or sad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group of participants were asked to draw shapes that were angry, sad, excited or peaceful. The angry and excited shapes had an average of 24 and 17 corners respectively (a high SC) whereas the sad and peaceful shapes had an average of 9 and 7 corners (a low SC). The SC of a shape could be used to predict its emotional label with close to 80 per cent accuracy, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Sievers and colleagues then analysed recordings of people moving around and also speaking emotionally-neutral sentences while expressing several different emotions. They found that angry speech and movements had a consistently higher SC than sad speech and movements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers think that the SC of someone’s voice or movements provides a clear signal of how strongly emotionally aroused they are. Being able to perceive this property automatically would clearly be useful for survival. If the person coming towards you is really angry, say, you’d want to pick up on that right away. But these associations seem to be so fundamental that we link any visual input or sound with a high SC (including spiky shapes, death metal and a brutalist building design) to the high-arousal emotions of anger or excitement, and anything with a low SC (such as clouds, the sound of lullabies and the swirling gravel of Zen gardens) to feeling calm (or possibly sad — context will clearly play a role).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This process could also account for the classic “cross-modal” finding, first reported in 1929 and replicated around the world many times since, that people tend to pair a blobby shape with a word-sound like “bouba” and a spiky shape with a word like “kiki”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When it comes to reading emotion in vocalisations, other animals may use a similar approach. In 2017, another team reported that English-, German- and Mandarin-speakers were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318702316_Humans_recognize_emotional_arousal_in_vocalizations_across_all_classes_of_terrestrial_vertebrates_Evidence_for_acoustic_universals&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink0&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;all able to identify higher levels of arousal in vocalisations from a range of species&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;, including amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The spectral centroid may relate to emotional arousal not just across cultures but across species, Sievers and colleagues write.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;“By understanding how the brain extracts low-level cross-modal features to determine meaning, we can build a deeper understanding of how communication can transcend immense geographic, cultural, and genetic variation,” the team concludes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.0513&quot;&gt;A multi-sensory code for emotional arousal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/airpollution-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fossil fuel use has enabled many of modern civilization’s comforts and conveniences, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.17226/12794&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it has also exacted a terrible public health toll&lt;/a&gt;. Experts have long understood that air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32345-0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contributes to many serious health problems&lt;/a&gt;, like asthma, heart disease and cancer. More recently, research has shown that air pollution &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbbf.org/sites/default/files/documents/2018-06/LinkFossilFuelsNeurologicalHarm_04-06-18_v2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;harms our brains and our mental abilities&lt;/a&gt; too—especially among children (including unborn babies), the elderly, and people living in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11238&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11238&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/brain-1-300x260.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Air pollution may cause delays in brain development, reduced IQ and learning difficulties. © Siarhei / stock.adobe.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For children, these harms include delays in development, reduced IQ, attention deficits, learning difficulties, behavioral problems, and autism, even when the exposure occurs before birth. In older adults, exposure to air pollution can contribute to dementia and possibly Alzheimer’s Disease.  People living in poverty are often most exposed to air pollution, because of where they work and live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/do-americans-understand-how-air-pollution-from-fossil-fuels-harms-health/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that many Americans are unaware of the myriad ways in which air pollution from fossil fuels harms our health. For example, only about half (55%) of Americans are able to name a single health impact, and the most frequently cited health effects are general (e.g., breathing problems) rather specific conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD). Notably, only one percent of Americans cited neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwy110&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1063357&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/NCLIMATE2009&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a transition away from fossil fuels toward a clean energy economy will dramatically improve public health. Thus, a key question becomes: what is the best way to build public support for a clean energy economy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out to answer this question by identifying specific evidence-based messages about the health effects of air pollution from fossil fuels that are the most concerning to Americans. Additionally, we sought to ascertain whether exposure to such messages would cause changes in people’s attitudes and behavioral intentions in a manner consistent with support for a transition to clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were most concerned about the potential harm to children’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we surveyed a large, demographically-diverse group of American adults (n=1644) and asked them to rank a set of ten different statements about the health effects of air pollution from fossil fuels in terms of which ones were the most and least concerning to them. We also assessed the cumulative impact of reading the ten statements by measuring participants’ attitudes about air pollution, fossil fuels, and clean energy both before and after the ranking task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that the harms to older adults’ brains as well as the more well-established harms associated with asthma, heart disease and cancer were of concern, but our participants were most concerned about the potential harm to children’s brains. What’s more, this general pattern of results was largely consistent across a number of partisan and demographic subgroups, even among older adults and those living in low-income households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the ranking exercise, Republicans, Independents, and Democrats alike exhibited increases in perceived health harm of air pollution and fossil fuels, a desire for more clean energy, and intention to engage in consumer advocacy to support clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11239&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11239 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/health-message-300x209.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Health professionals could lead the way in public engagement efforts. © natali_mis / stock.adobe.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research findings are not unique; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.05.004&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other teams&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa557&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; are reaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/nenergy.2017.107&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;similar conclusions&lt;/a&gt;. In total, these studies provide strong evidence of the value of communicating about the health effects associated with burning fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to communicate about the harms of air pollution to heart and lung disease and cancer are reasonably well-established— thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/outdoor/fighting-for-healthy-air/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the efforts of the American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt; and others—and should be continued. Efforts should now be organized to communicate about the harmful effects of burning fossil fuels on our brains, particularly the neurodevelopmental impacts on babies and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health messages have great potential to help the public and policymakers understand what’s really at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health professionals and health organizations are the ideal messengers to be leading these public engagement efforts, because doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other professionals are among the most trusted members of every community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health messages about air pollution and fossil fuels—delivered repeatedly in clear terms by a variety of trusted health professionals—have great potential to help the public and policymakers understand what’s really at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have the potential to involve important new stakeholders and other trusted voices—like groups concerned about the wellbeing of babies before birth—who have not traditionally been involved in the campaign to clean our air. This public engagement strategy offers the very real possibility of breaking through the political gridlock for the benefit everyone’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

But rather than anger the NRA with tiny incremental changes to control access to firearms, a better approach is to develop a national plan to stigmatize people with mental illnesses, who are more likely to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmhadurham.ca/finding-help/the-myth-of-violence-and-mental-illness/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;victims of violent crime&lt;/a&gt; than the perpetrators:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/22/white-house-considers-new-project-seeking-links-between-mental-health-violent-behavior/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;White House considers new project seeking links between mental health and violent behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bob Wright, the former NBC chair and a Trump friend, is one of the proposal’s supporters.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The White House has been briefed on a proposal to develop a way to identify early signs of changes in people with mental illness that could lead to violent behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supporters see the plan as a way President Trump could move the ball forward on gun control following recent mass shootings as efforts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-denies-that-he-told-nra-chief-universal-background-checks-are-off-the-table/2019/08/21/38f4d56c-c42c-11e9-b5e4-54aa56d5b7ce_story.html&quot;&gt;seem to be flagging&lt;/a&gt; to impose harsher restrictions such as background checks on gun purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proposal is part of a larger initiative to establish a new agency called the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Health Advanced Research Projects Agency or HARPA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which would sit inside the Health and Human Services Department. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Its director would be appointed by the president&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and the agency would have a separate budget, according to three people with knowledge of conversations around the plan. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suzannewrightfoundation.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Suzanne Wright Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, started by Bob Wright to fight pancreatic cancer after his wife died from the disease, has advocated for the formation of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA&quot; title=&quot;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&quot;&gt;DARPA&lt;/a&gt;-like federal agency called HARPA.

Despite internal support over the past two years, the model ran into what was described as “institutional barriers to progress,” according to a person familiar with the conversations. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/good-girls-recap-season-1-episode-6.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot; Season 1 Episode 6 of 'Good Girls'&quot;&gt;flip your game&lt;/a&gt; by seizing a tragic moment in time to transform yourself into legacy-making material? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“[Trump is] very achievement oriented and I think all presidents have difficulties with science,” Wright said in an interview. “I think their political advisers say, ‘No that’s not a game for you,’ so they sort of back off a bit.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He added: “But the president has a real opportunity here to leave a legacy in health care.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newly-realized HARPA would use artificial intelligence, machine learning, commercial surveillance technology (e.g., Apple Watches, Fitbits, Amazon Echo, Google Home), and “powerful tools [&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;] collected by health-care provides like fMRIs, tractography and image analysis.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;HARPA  would develop “breakthrough technologies with high specificity and  sensitivity for early diagnosis of neuropsychiatric violence,” says a  copy of the proposal. “A multi-modality solution, along with real-time  data analytics, is needed to achieve such an accurate diagnosis.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And because of her vast experience in these technologies and her theoretical contributions to the neuroethics of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(17)30241-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Predicting Violent Behavior: What Can Neuroscience Add?&quot;&gt;predicting violent behavior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivanka Trump is the best person to lead such an effort&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“It would be perfect for her to do it — we need someone with some horsepower — someone like her driving it. ... It could get done,” said one official familiar with the conversations. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://splinternews.com/oh-good-white-house-reportedly-considering-dystopian-p-1837471162&quot;&gt;Oh Good, White House Reportedly Considering Dystopian Plan to Try to Detect the Next Mass Shooter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cwanderson.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Philip-K-Dick-The-Minority-Report.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Minority Report&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Philip K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of birth order in shaping who we are has been a matter of some debate in psychology. Recent research has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/14/1506451112&quot;&gt;cast doubt&lt;/a&gt; on the idea that an individual’s position in relation to their siblings influences their personality, for instance. But there may be other domains where birth order is still important: in particular, researchers have found that children with a greater number of older siblings seem to have worse verbal skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619861436&quot;&gt;new study published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;has found that the situation is a bit more complicated than that.  Young children with an older sibling do indeed perform worse on language measures, the authors find — but only if that sibling is a brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37673&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents only have a limited amount of time and attention they can split between their children, so the more siblings a child has, the less input they will personally receive from their parents. As parents play an important role in their child’s language development, this could explain why those with a greater number of older siblings have worse language skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi Havron at PSL Université and colleagues were interested in how this effect is influenced by the age and sex of an older sibling. There may be less of a negative impact if there is a bigger age gap between siblings, or if the older sibling is a girl, the researchers reasoned. A much older sibling will have better verbal skills, so could themselves become a useful source for younger children to learn about language. And girls tend to have more advanced language skills than boys, so a sister may also provide better input to their younger sibling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test these theories, Havron and colleagues looked at data from an ongoing French cohort study called EDEN, which has followed children, and their mothers, from before birth through to age 11. At ages 2, 3 and 5-6, the children’s language skills were measured: at age 2 this simply involved mothers indicating which words their child could say, but at later ages children completed tests such as repeating words and sentences, naming pictures and listing animals. The team analysed the data from 1,276 children who had completed the language tests, including 547 who had an older brother or sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that, on average, children who had an older sibling had worse language skills than those who didn’t. But as they predicted, the sex of an older sibling was important: kids with older sisters had better language skills than those with older brothers. In fact, a subsequent analysis showed that children with an older sister didn’t actually differ in their language skills from those with no older sibling. On the other hand, the age gap between the siblings didn’t appear to make any difference to language ability after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not yet clear why children perform better when they have older sisters, the researchers write. It could be that sisters have better language abilities or are more nurturing than brothers — but another possible explanation is that sisters are less demanding on their parents, taking less parental attention away from their younger siblings than do brothers. Whatever the reason, the authors say,  “it … might be more accurate to think of the well-established negative older-sibling effect as an older-brother effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having an older brother isn’t all bad. Other studies have found that children with older siblings are actually &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; at some of the social aspects of language, like joining in conversations. And it’s also important to note that although statistically significant, the size of the effects in the study were rather small — and restricted to just a sample of French speakers. It remains to be seen whether similar results are seen in children in other cultures or who speak other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619861436&quot;&gt;The Effect of Older Siblings on Language Development as a Function of Age Difference and Sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This month's episode is the beginning a four part series about the Neuroscience of Consciousness. This month I am discussing and comparing the ideas from several recent books on the subject in preparation for several upcoming interviews on the subject. Many people consider consciousness to be the biggest mystery of all, but in this episode we explore how progress has been made in unraveling the  ultimate &quot;mystery of how our brain makes us human.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Books featured in BS 160 (listed in the order cited):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2GVDG6T&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Stanislas Dehaene (2014)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2YXD9I4&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Sean Carroll (2016)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2SMG0o4&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;The Strange Order of Things: Life, Feeling, and the Making of Cultures&lt;/a&gt; by Antonio Damasio (2018)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2YRKxtg&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel C.

PLOS is excited to be among the first publishers to offer direct transfer service from the new server.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Earlier this summer, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cshl.edu/new-preprint-server-for-the-health-sciences-announced-today/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; the launch of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;medRxiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/preprints&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; server specifically designed for the health sciences. A corollary to CSHL’s popular bioRxiv platform, founded in 2013, medRxiv offers the same quick and easy posting process, plus an additional enhanced screening process to protect patient information, ensure high ethical standards, and guard against posting any potentially harmful health information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Publicly posting preprints &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;benefits the research community broadly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, as well as individual scientists. Sharing results early accelerates the pace of scientific advancement while helping to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. In the health sciences specifically, preprints &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;can be an effective tool for sharing information during an outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Preprints empower researchers to choose when and how their work is shared, opening new opportunities to collaborate, earn credit and citations, and get helpful feedback–even as the manuscript undergoes peer review at a journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re thrilled to welcome medRxiv as the newest addition to the Open Science community, and look forward to continuing to develop our collaboration together in future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Over the past six months, arXiv has been developing a Code of Conduct (CoC) (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/policies/code_of_conduct&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/help/policies/code_of_conduct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;) that reflects the values of arXiv and sets expectations for the responsibilities of individuals within the arXiv community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our CoC encourages positive interactions between users and holds individuals accountable for their communication on arXiv. If you have concerns about any interactions you are involved in or observe, you can refer it. The CoC is now in effect and part of arXiv policies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The CoC developed with input from arXiv staff, moderators, and advisory board members.

The European conference on Computational Biology (ECCB) is a major bioinformatics and computational biology meeting which is held jointly with the ISMB meeting every two years. Together, ISMB/ECCB brings together people from the fields of computer science, molecular biology, mathematics, statistics and other related fields, showcasing the best and latest developments in bioinformatics and computational biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference is focused on its Communities of Special Interest, or COSIs. There were 20 COSI tracks and workshops present, all representing major research areas in the field of computational biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISMBECCB  2019 took place in Basel, Switzerland. In general, the conference is very much focused on its Communities of Special Interest, or COSIs. There were 20 COSI tracks and workshops present at the meeting this year, all representing major research areas in the field of computational biology. Each COSI ran their own sessions (COSI tracks) as part of the conference. There were also a number of Special Sessions, Technology Tracks  and two Special Tracks (on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/bd2k.php&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Big Data to Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; (BD2K) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/elixir.php&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine from such a comprehensive, multi-track program, it’s simply not possible to cover everything here. But here is a quick summary of some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keynote speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is always the case at ISCB conferences, delegates were treated to a number of excellent presentations by some prestigious keynote speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdc-berlin.de/n-rajewsky&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nikolaus Rajewsky&lt;/a&gt;, from the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine, presenting his work using single-cell approaches to investigate gene regulation in space and time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;William Stafford Noble&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Washington, on using machine learning methods to gain insights in complex genomic or proteomic data and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lab.dessimoz.org/people/christophe-dessimoz&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Christophe Dessimoz&lt;/a&gt;, who discussed his research on the challenges and rewards of benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather excitingly, the conference offered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iscb.org/iscblive-streaming-content&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;live-streaming&lt;/a&gt; of all the Distinguished Keynotes for all ISCB members that were not able to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, ISCB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iscb.org/iscb-awards&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gives out four awards to recognize specific achievements&lt;/a&gt; by researchers in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, it included William Stafford Noble, winner of the ISCB Innovator award, who has recently joined the &lt;em&gt;BMC Bioinformatics&lt;/em&gt; editorial board as an Associate Editor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other winners include Bonnie Berger (ISCB Accomplishment by a senior scientist award), Barb Bryant (Outstanding contributions to ISCB award) and Christophe Dessimov (ISCB Overton prize).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting young scientists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the meeting wasn’t just about the top scientists in the field. It was  was opened with a one day student symposium, with tutorials on a wide range of topics including interpretability for deep learning models, visualization of large biological data and tools for reproducible research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were over 1,100 posters on display at the conference, many from early career researchers, the lively sessions giving young scientists an opportunity to talk about their work;  there were posters from different categories throughout the conference on a very diverse range of topics. Just to give a flavor on what was on display, there were posters on energetic conflicts in the catalytic sites of proteins, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/scdo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Sickle Cell Disease Ontology&lt;/a&gt;, modeling of immune responses to Clostridium difficile infection, “Nightingale”, which is a library of reusable data visualization components and a number of posters on bioinformatics teaching and teaching resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11210 alignright&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/20190724_123934-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference also introduced CompBio Ignite talks, providing researchers not selected for oral presentations the opportunity to give a six-minute so called “lighting style” talk throughout the lunch hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting the scientific community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned, the ISMB has a well-established collaboration with a number of Communities of Special Interest (COSIs), including&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/sysmod.php&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; SysMod: Computational Modeling of Biological Systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/mlcsb.php&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MLCSB: Machine Learning in Computational and Systems Biology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/3dsig.php&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;3DSIG: Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biophysics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keynote at the 3DSIG session, presented by Torsten Schwede, from the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, was a celebration of 25 years of the automated protein structure homology-modelling server, SWISS-MODEL, its recent progress and some key lessons have been learned throughout its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting talks in the MLCSB COSI session described DrugCell, a “visible” neural network based artificial intelligence that predicts anti-cancer drug responses, taking into account structural features of the drugs themselves as well as the genomic features of the cells affected. The researchers found that the compound that performed best was the drug vincristine, with the neural network highlighting the well-defined pathways affected by the drug, such as cell adhesion and division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the SysMod keynote, presented by Trey Ideker, presented the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccmi.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cancer Map Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, the aim of the project being to produce a complete map of the gene and protein wiring diagram of a cancer cell, information that is vital for developing computational models of cancer cells for both basic and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that struck me about this conference was the support given to young researchers, not only in terms of the training program, but also giving them the opportunity to describe their research to a specialized audience and the possibility of networking and setting up collaborations. The field of computational biology is exciting and fast paced and I particularly enjoyed the MLCSB sessions and hearing more about Elixir and the work they do to support some of the field’s most important resources. I look forward to attending the ISMB conference next year, which will be held in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Is it possible to spot the signs of future psychopathy in a child? Some researchers have argued that it is &lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;— &lt;/span&gt;by looking at the child’s level of “interpersonal callousness” (IC), or the extent to which they are manipulative, dishonest, and show a lack of guilt, remorse or distress at being punished. Indeed, previous studies have found that children who rank high for IC are more likely to develop psychopathic features, as well as to commit violent offences in adolescence and adulthood. So, case closed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-39486-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Abnormal Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. This work, led by Meagan Docherty and Jordan Beardslee at Arizona State University, suggests that other important risk factors for these negative outcomes in adolescence and adulthood haven’t been properly taken into account — and that when they are, the apparent link between childhood callousness and psychopathy in adulthood disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37657&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Docherty and Beardslee’s team analysed data collected for the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS), in which boys were regularly interviewed and assessed using a variety of measures, from their early childhood in the late 1980s through to adulthood. The PYS group was deliberately skewed to over-include boys who, based on early problem behaviour, were considered to be at a higher risk of going on to commit serious crimes. The datasets also included any official records of later offending, and the results of follow-up assessments of psychopathic features, physical aggression and antisocial behaviour on into adulthood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 503 participants included in this study had been rated for callousness each year from the ages of 8 to 15 by their teachers, who assessed their level of agreement with statements like “doesn’t seem to feel guilty after misbehaving.” The team divided the participants into various callousness groups: those deemed to have low, moderate or high IC levels, for example; groups who’d shown callousness only during childhood, or in whom it appeared only in adolescence; and also a group in which IC developed early on and remained high and stable. They then compared this data with levels of psychopathic features (such as being manipulative or antisocial) and physical aggression at age 29, and also, as a measure of antisocial behaviour, official criminal records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers also took into account a number of potentially confounding factors that might themselves relate to later violent crimes or psychopathy. These included any records of arrests by age 15, and also “externalising” behaviours (physical aggression, verbal bullying and defiance, for example) during adolescence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these factors were included in the analysis, membership of the various callousness groups during childhood or adolescence did not predict later adult psychopathic features. This means that people who’d been deemed to have high IC as children were no more likely to show signs of psychopathy in adulthood than those who’d had no or low levels of callousness in childhood. “These results suggest that the stability from IC early in life to psychopathic features in adulthood might be overstated in prior studies that do not control for early problem behaviours,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There were, though, associations between certain callousness groups and aggression and antisocial behaviour in adolescence and adulthood. Those participants with early-onset, high-level and stable callousness were more likely to be aggressive and to engage in serious violence in adulthood. (Members of this particular IC group were two to three times more likely to be arrested for serious violence than those in any other IC group.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The team says that they would like to see more research into why IC follows distinct patterns in different young people. Perhaps warm parenting can ‘treat’ deficits in moral development, which might appear as symptoms of IC in childhood that vanish by adolescence, for example; in contrast, harsh parenting might encourage the emergence of IC in otherwise typical adolescents. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%252Fabn0000449&quot;&gt;Developmental Trajectories of Interpersonal Callousness From Childhood to Adolescence as Predictors of Antisocial Behavior and Psychopathic Features in Young Adulthood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875-1961) was one of the best-known psychologists of the 20th century. He introduced such famous concepts as introverted and extraverted personalities, and the idea of the psychological 'complex'.



Today, Jungian or analytical psychology retains an active community. But a recently published Open Letter from a number of prominent Jungians points to troubles within the fold.



The letter acknowledges that Jung's writings contained racism, and apologizes for</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/7-690x3203-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Note: This blog was written by Renee Hoch, Senior Editor, Team Manager for &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;’s Publication Ethics Editorial team&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The integrity of image data in primary research articles has emerged as a major concern in publication ethics. Studies querying the frequency of image concerns have indicated that 4-25% of published research articles in the biomedical and life sciences may include unreported image splicing, duplications, and/or manipulations with potential repercussions for the reliability of the results [1-4]. These issues can stem from honest errors, efforts to beautify or clarify the results, poor data management, poor knowledge as to best practice standards in image data reporting, or fraudulent misrepresentation of experimental results. Whatever the root cause, image integrity issues can damage the reliability of – and public trust in – the scientific literature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can journals do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Up to now the majority of image concern cases at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;have been raised post-publication, although some are spotted during peer review. We follow up on such issues regardless of when they are raised, but it would benefit authors, journals, and readers to try to identify and address more of these concerns prior to publication. To this end, as discussed recently at the 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; World Conference on Research Integrity, some journals have implemented dedicated pre-publication image screening; developers are working on software tools to help identify issues such as splicing and duplications; and a group at the Headt Center in Berlin is developing an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://headt.eu/The-Image-Integrity-Database/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Image Integrity Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; [5] that can be used to test new software tools. Solutions are needed which can be applied at scale within the context of journal checks and/or peer review. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, we are taking a policy-based approach to proactively address image integrity for blot and gel results: we now require that authors submit the underlying raw images to support all blot and gel image data reported in a submission’s figures or supporting information files. The raw data will be assessed during peer review (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;) or before acceptance (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), and if a manuscript is accepted the underlying image data will be published as supporting information or provided via a public data repository. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why require raw blot and gel data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our new policy focuses on blot and gel reporting because these types of  images comprise the most prevalent category of image concerns that our editorial teams handle, and the raw image data underlying these figures are particularly informative in clarifying the reliability of the reported results. Under the new policy, editors and reviewers will have access to the underlying image data before publication so that they can verify the reported results and consider these data when making decisions as to whether the work complies with the journals’ guidelines and publication requirements. With the raw data, editors and reviewers will be better equipped to identify any concerns about these results in the context of peer review, so that authors can address questions about their data and resolve honest data reporting errors prior to publication. With this new policy and the support of our authors, Academic Editors, and reviewers, we aim to strengthen the integrity and reproducibility of our published articles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new policy will bring our data reporting requirements for blot and gel results into better alignment with PLOS’ and the greater community’s open data-sharing objectives. Since 2014, PLOS’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Data Availability Policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; has required that authors provide the underlying data supporting an article’s results. For image data, our policy has specified that authors provide “sample” images to support the results, but has not provided clear instructions about our expectations for sample images. One could consider published figure panels to be representative sample images but these rarely include the original image data: images are typically cropped, adjusted, and in some cases manipulated (stretched, spliced, contrast adjusted, etc.) during figure preparation. While such alterations may be acceptable if transparently reported and abiding by best practice standards, they can also lead to questions about a figure’s integrity, make it difficult to assess the results, and in some cases lead to loss of important information such as about reagent specificity or experimental controls. The original data play an essential role in clarifying such issues when raised, but unfortunately authors are often unable to provide these data after publication (Figure 1 and [6]). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our new policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; clarifies our blot/gel image data requirements in detail, and aims to ensure the availability of blot/gel image data after  an article’s publication. We have also updated our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-reporting-blot-and-gel-results&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;blot/gel reporting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-preparing-figures-from-image-files&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;figure preparation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; guidelines to increase awareness of best practices in blot and gel presentation and support transparency in data reporting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We sincerely thank all who provided advice on these recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; updates, and we thank our authors in advance for working with us towards these higher image data reporting standards.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world made for right-handed people, life can sometimes be frustrating if you are among the 10% or so who are “adextral” — that is, left-handed or ambidextrous. Now a new grievance can be added to the list. Brain imaging researchers are systematically excluding adextrals from participating in their studies, according to an analysis of recent research papers published in top neuroimaging journals. Yet there’s no good reason to exclude this population, say the authors — and in fact, the practice could be detrimental to research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37652&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tendency to include only right-handed people in neuroimaging research stems from the finding that certain processes are represented differently in the brains of adextrals. In particular, while the left hemisphere of the brain dominates language processing in almost all right-handed people, in about 30% of adextrals this processing occurs predominantly in the right hemisphere (or both hemispheres). Handedness also influences how the brain represents sensation and movement of the hands. Many neuropsychologists have therefore avoided recruiting adextrals for fear of affecting their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lyam Bailey and colleagues at Dalhousie University noticed that researchers were excluding adextrals from a range of studies unrelated to language or movement, even though there is little evidence that handedness influences other processes. So in &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejn.14542&quot;&gt;their new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;European of Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, the team investigated whether there is evidence for this bias in the literature. The researchers looked at 1,008 articles published in three major neuroimaging journals across the course of 2017, noting whether each study reported participants’ handedness — and if so, how many adextral participants were included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that a little over half of the studies reported participants’ handedness. But of the almost 32,000 people in those studies, only 3.2% were adextral — considerably lower than the rate of 10-13% in the general population. Overall, fewer than one in five of the studies that reported handedness included any adextrals at all, suggesting that most were actively excluding these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, studies looking at clinical populations and children were more likely to include adextral participants than those on non-clinical and adult populations. The authors suggest that this may be because it is harder to recruit from these populations, so researchers are more willing to include non-right-handed people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are not necessarily that surprising, though it is interesting to see the hard data to back up what many neuropsychologists may have already expected. But the key question is — does it matter that adextrals are underrepresented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors make a convincing case that it does. Handedness is just another kind of individual difference, the researchers write, much like memory capacity or socioeconomic status. Both of those factors can also influence how language is represented in the brain, but are not normally used as a basis for excluding people from research. And we can only fully understand whether there are any differences in the brains of right- and left-handed people if both groups are actually included in research. “Handedness should be treated with the same measured scientific curiosity that is now afforded to individual differences such as language proficiency, working memory capacity [and] SES,” write the researchers. Instead of excluding adextrals, they add, statistical methods can be used to control for any potential effects of handedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that’s not enough, the logic for excluding adextrals even from language studies is flawed, say Bailey and colleagues. Although 30% of adextrals don’t show the normal left hemisphere language lateralisation, the same is true for about 4% of right-handed people. And because adextrals already represent a much smaller proportion of the population, including them will have little impact on how many participants have this “atypical lateralisation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say they hope their work will encourage others to take a hard look at whether they really need to be excluding adextrals from their studies. “Such a change in attitudes will surely benefit both our understanding of how handedness relates to brain function, organization and structure and, more broadly, our understanding of the brain at the whole-population level,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejn.14542&quot;&gt;A sinister subject: Quantifying handedness-based recruitment biases in current neuroimaging research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout our lives, we set ourselves goals — to pass an exam, run a marathon, lose 10 kilograms of excess weight or gain a promotion. Given the importance of such goals to our physical and psychological wellbeing, it’s not surprising that there’s has been a wealth of research into how best to set, work towards, and achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s say you succeed — what then? Psychologists have paid less attention to people’s behaviour &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they’ve achieved their goals. And although it’s generally good for us to continue to study, exercise, eat healthily, work hard, and so on, this doesn’t always transpire. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21538&quot;&gt;one follow-up&lt;/a&gt; of contestants who’d won the weight-loss TV show &lt;em&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/em&gt; found that six years on, most weighed even more than they had at the start of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-34220-001&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition&lt;/em&gt; offers a solution. People are more likely to maintain good behaviours, the researchers find, if instead of thinking about achieving a goal as “arriving at a destination,” they view it as “completing a journey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37644&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rely heavily on metaphor when considering abstract concepts and aspects of our lives. So Szu-Chi Huang and Jennifer Aaker at the Stanford Graduate School of Business reasoned that thinking about a goal as the completion of a journey might prompt people to reflect on how they had been at the start, and all the ups and downs along the way. This might make them feel that they had changed to be the kind of person who engages in these specific behaviours, and make them more likely to maintain them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of six studies involving more than 1,600 people, this is exactly what the pair found. They first looked at two groups comprising more than 400 American students and university staff who had recently achieved &lt;span&gt;either&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an academic or a fitness goal. Participants were asked to think about how their experience of attaining the goal was like “completing a journey” or “reaching a destination,” or were just told to think about achieving the goal without a metaphor attached. Those who viewed the goal as the completion of a journey not only expressed stronger intentions to continue the goal-related behaviours, but actually did so (the fitness journey group were more likely to sign up for an ongoing fitness programme, for example).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In subsequent research, the team further characterised this effect. In one study, 265 dieters set themselves daily calorie intake goals and tracked their consumption over seven days. After the end of the diet programme, those who thought about their achievement as the completion of a journey were again more likely to indicate that they would continue their dieting behaviour. And importantly, this group also had greater feelings of personal growth, suggesting this could be the underlying mechanism for the effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, which involved a 14-day walking programme with a goal of achieving 100,000 steps, revealed that the journey metaphor encouraged beneficial behaviour after participants had attained their goal, but not when they were getting close to achieving it. When a goal is in sight, but not yet achieved, “focusing on the destination aspects of this path could be more motivating, likely because it accentuated the end goal that one still needed to achieve,” the pair notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the phenomenon was not just restricted to American participants. In a final study, the researchers followed 106 executives who were finishing a business education programme in Ghana. In what they were told was an exit interview, the participants were encouraged to describe their attainment of their qualification using a journey or a destination metaphor. Six months on, members of the journey group were more likely to be using practices they had learned on the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that getting people to think about their journey to achieving a goal might not always work, or may even backfire — if the journey has been very hard or unpleasant, for example. However, the researchers add, “it is our hope that this research serves as the beginning of a journey of diverse research programs that utilize a variety of metaphors to enhance goal pursuers’ chances of maintaining their success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-34220-001&quot;&gt;It’s the journey, not the destination: How metaphor drives growth after goal attainment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/Blog-Header-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest Authors: Dylan Roskams-Edris (Open Science Consultant and Invited Scholar with the Center for Genomics and Policy,), JB Poline (Associate Professor, Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University), and Nikola Stikov (Associate Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First off, what is Plan S and why does it matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/&quot;&gt;a group of European funding agencies, along with some private funders&lt;/a&gt;, assessed how scientific information is disseminated – namely that university researchers receive public funding, perform experiments, collect data, write articles about the results, review each other’s articles, and then the publicly funded institutions they work for foot the ever increasing bill to buy access to all this work – and decided enough was enough; publicly funded science should be publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They formed&lt;em&gt; cOAlition S&lt;/em&gt; and announced &lt;em&gt;Plan S&lt;/em&gt; which, boiled down, says that after 2020 any work funded in whole or in part by the members of the coalition must be published in journals that allow immediate, free, and public access to articles. They also published a set of guidelines and best practices that journals publishing funded research must follow. Those interested in the details of Plan S are encouraged to read about them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 5 months after Plan S was revealed, the University of California system – one of the largest and most well-respected public academic systems in the world – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-terminates-subscriptions-worlds-largest-scientific-publisher-push-open-access-publicly&quot;&gt;announced that they were ending their relationship with the publisher Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;. The split was due primarily to Elsevier’s refusal to make all UC published research open access on the UC’s terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These efforts are a great start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those actively working to open global research efforts, however, efforts like Plan S are only the beginning. The push for open science is much larger than making scholarly articles open access. Open science demands that the data, software, materials, and know-how that enables science are also shared – or better yet, openly published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing, Publishing, and Open Access Articles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth pausing here for a brief aside about the distinction between open sharing, open publishing of research resources, and open access publishing of articles. All of these are important but for open science to be successful the distinction between them has to be clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open sharing consists of making research resources available in a way they can be freely accessed and used. Sharing datasets in a repository or data sharing platform like &lt;a href=&quot;https://datadryad.org/pages/organization&quot;&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;, or code used for data analysis and visualization via a service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, are good examples. Sharing in this way rapidly disseminates resources and makes them available for use and adaptation by others as quickly as possible. Open publishing of research resources, however, involves the filtration of these resources through other researchers. These peer researchers make sure that the shared resource – whether it is data, code, single figures, or any of the plethora of resources developed throughout the scientific process – is in a form that is standard and easily usable by others, as well as presenting those resources in a curated form on a website or repository. Open access publishing of articles is the primary target of efforts like Plan S and relates to publishing scholarly articles in such a way that they are freely accessible and usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://conp.ca/&quot;&gt;The Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform&lt;/a&gt; (CONP), along with myriad other organizations, are developing the resources needed to enable open sharing, open publishing of research resources, and open publishing of articles. By doing so the CONP is helping open science and reduce the current inequalities in access to all of the tools and research outputs science needs to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Publications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessing the situation here in Canada, the current &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_F6765465.html?OpenDocument&quot;&gt;open access policies of Canada’s primary trio of scientific funding agencies&lt;/a&gt; take a weaker stance than Plan S and, as we’ve already argued, efforts like Plan S are only a start. Even if Canada were to suddenly marshal its forces of scientific-policy and follow the lead of cOAlition S we would still be well behind where open science should be. Scholarly papers are just the tip of the iceberg of scientific discovery. Any given publication is the result of months of work involving data collection, coming up with hypotheses, planning experiments, carefully recording progress in notebooks, developing software, analyzing results, writing drafts, and working with editors. The iceberg metaphor is a good one; the publication, like the burg’s tip, is what is seen, but floats atop a much larger body of work that supports it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/Iceberg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-8719&quot; height=&quot;447&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/Iceberg.png&quot; width=&quot;482&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open science in its full and rich instantiation is about sharing and publishing all as many scientific resources as possible to enable collaboration throughout the research process. It grows from the simple idea that working together is more effective than working in silos; that many hands make light work and many eyes spot more errors. In order to work together scientists need to be able to freely discover each other’s work and use each other’s resources, not just have access to the polished end result. Doing so will improve replication, catch errors in methodology early on, and prevent redundancy, all while reducing unnecessary barriers to discovery and outlays from the public coffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet and modern computing technology make this dissemination possible. What we need now is for funders, institutions, and scientists themselves to commit to encouraging and enabling the sharing their data, code, notebooks, experimental protocols, draft manuscripts, and all the other pivotal elements of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building on Plan S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan S does mention the sharing of scientific data. On their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/&quot;&gt;Principles and Implementation&lt;/a&gt; page they encourage the sharing of research resources underlying publications in repositories that make the resource “as open as possible and as closed as necessary”, as well as highlighting resource sharing as a key topic of negotiations between journals, funders, and institutions. Doing so, however, requires repositories where data and code that can be stored, data sharing platforms where that data can easily linked to publications, as well as organized curation efforts to make sure the linked research resources are usable by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CONP is building exactly these resources for the neuroscience community. It is collaboratively developing the user portal, online publishing, informational resources, and governance and policy mechanisms that will enable neuroscientists to disseminate each component of their work as openly as possible, and to keep them open. The CONP scientists and stakeholders believe that these resources will catalyze collaboration and accelerate neuroscientific discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Needed Now to Go Further&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening science requires the collective effort of funders, data sharing platforms, academic institutions, and individual scientists. Science doesn’t have to be opened all at once, but steps down the open road must be taken, and must be taken now. The CONP will provide tools and guidance, but scientific culture shift requires a concerted community effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some first steps needed to enable the open publishing of all research resources include: (1) forging agreements and partnerships between journals and open science platforms to make it easy for scientists to share their data, publish it in a curated form, and link it to publications, (2) promotion and tenure policies at academic institutions that value the sharing and publishing of data &lt;em&gt;on par&lt;/em&gt; with producing articles, (3) funding agencies that require (and enforce) sharing and publishing data, code, and materials associated with publications as a condition of receiving a grant, and (4) a commitment from scientists themselves to change the culture of science towards openly sharing and publishing as many of their resources as they can.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/tick-2371782_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease is transmitted through the bite of specific ticks and has a variety of clinical presentations, most notably a bull’s eye rash (erythema migrans) and an associated flu-like illness. Its distribution through Europe is heterogenous with a large variation in incidence between countries and within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over an eighteen-year period (1998-2015) we observed a six-fold increase in cases seen in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, information relating to infected patients’ characteristics, where they live and how they are managed within the National Health Service (NHS), is poorly understood. Currently most information is derived from Public Health England’s and Health Protection Scotland’s laboratory surveillance schemes. We are very fortunate that in England and Wales, data from all NHS hospitals are readily available, which enables the analysis of a variety of different medical conditions at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the analysis of these data we were able to describe which Lyme disease patients access hospitals for management and treatment, and for the first time, start to describe how patients enter and progress through NHS care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over an eighteen-year period (1998-2015) we observed a six-fold increase in cases seen in hospitals. Numbers of cases that require hospital admission are still relatively low compared to national surveillance figures. Most Lyme disease cases are confirmed and treated with antibiotics by a GP without the need for laboratory diagnosis or referral to a hospital. UK national surveillance figures are based solely on laboratory-confirmed cases. These figures will include a mixture of cases from primary care and hospitals. Therefore, current surveillance figures will always have a higher incidence than hospital cases alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease patients attending hospitals were predominantly female and self-identified as white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases that require hospital admission likely represent more clinically complex cases. They are also substantially lower than similar hospital figures reported in continental Europe. We found that cases peaked each year in August; this is consistent with people being active outdoors whilst ticks are questing for a blood meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease patients attending hospitals were predominantly female and self-identified as white. The ages most affected were young children (6-10 years old) and adults approaching retirement age (61-65 years old).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11191&quot; style=&quot;width: 343px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11191&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/Figure-3-300x243.png&quot; width=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 3 – Population demographics of Lyme disease patients within hospital administrative records in England and Wales (1998-2015)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all parts of England and Wales reported Lyme disease cases attending hospitals with clear hotspots of disease in central southern England. This highlights that while Lyme disease poses a risk across both countries, for most people this risk is likely to be very low as the majority of cases were found in these hotspots. Unsurprisingly, more cases were found in rural rather than urban locations. These data are based on where a patient lives rather than where they were bitten and so provides a more accurate estimate of where clinical burden will be placed on NHS hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is one of only a handful that describe the sociodemographics of the population affected by Lyme disease. We found a trend that increasing numbers of new patients were found in parts of the countries that are considered to have low levels of economic deprivation. The data collected gives no indication why this is the case and it is likely to be due to multiple factors. Further research is needed to identify vulnerable parts of the population which would aid in future tick bite prevention and Lyme disease awareness campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most novel part of the research describes how patients with Lyme disease are managed within hospitals and the NHS. The majority of patients were only admitted once and stayed  4.47 days, on average. 35.5% of all patients were admitted as a day case. The variety in admission length and departments treating the patient could represent either diversity and complexity of Lyme disease symptoms or differing management strategies within hospitals. This needs to be explored as it appears that the management of Lyme disease patients in hospitals is discordant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11193&quot; style=&quot;width: 378px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11193&quot; height=&quot;343&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/Figure-4-300x279.png&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 4 – The average incidence rate of Lyme disease in English and Welsh local authorities (n=348), (1998-2015)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than thirty percent of patients with Lyme disease enter hospital through the accident and emergency department. It is unlikely that all of these patients have acute symptoms. Why are patients accessing care through this route? It could be due to a lack of knowledge or the inability to get an appointment with a primary care clinician. This requires further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, like previous ones based on administrative data, may be limited by some patients not being coded correctly as having Lyme disease in hospital records. It would be difficult to truly validate the cases we identified without reading each patients written hospital notes, this would be ethically challenging. Despite these limitations, the strong trends described in this paper may indicate that these are small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linking this data to both primary care and laboratory data would facilitate a better account of the Lyme disease patient care pathway. Adding to our understanding of these factors could lead to better patient care, education and resource allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease patients are seen at most hospitals across England and Wales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research has highlighted that Lyme disease patients are seen at most hospitals across England and Wales. However, Lyme disease presentation in hospital is an uncommon event except in southern-central England. Patient care within the NHS is not streamlined and may reflect variation in patient management or the range of Lyme disease symptoms. This work can provide a reference point to future Lyme disease research in the United Kingdom and any Lyme disease hospital-based research internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being aware of the signs &amp;amp; symptoms of Lyme Disease is important so that you can receive early diagnosis and treatment from your family doctor. Symptoms typically develop up to 3 weeks after being bitten by a tick and include a spreading circular red rash or flu-like symptoms. When you visit your GP or call NHS 111, remember to tell them where you have been and if you remember being bitten.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 8:07am on a Saturday morning in early 2018, phones throughout Hawaii buzzed with a distressing message. “Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter,” it read. “This is not a drill.” Similar warnings interrupted television and radio transmissions. And until a follow-up message 38 minutes later clarified that it had been a false alarm, many residents were left expecting the worst&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343186&quot;&gt;according to a new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/em&gt;, the toll on Hawaii residents lasted much longer than those terrifying minutes. Researchers analysing the kinds of words tweeted before and after the false alarm have found that anxiety seemed to be heightened for days — particularly among those who appeared the least anxious to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37638&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous experimental work has suggested that the anxiety provoked by an imminent, unavoidable threat like an electric shock increases as the expected event draws closer — and continues to persist even after it is revealed to have been a false alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these findings have been restricted to artificial scenarios in the lab, note Nickolas Jones and Roxane Cohen Silver in the new paper. So the pair turned to the Hawaii missile alert to see whether similar patterns of anxiety occur after a real-world false alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the tweets of &lt;span&gt;almost 15,000 Twitter users, all of whom were following Hawaiian organisations,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the 6 weeks before and 3 weeks after the alert. To get a measure of anxiety, they calculated the proportion of tweets that contained anxiety words (like “afraid” or “worried”) listed in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count programme, a tool often used by psychologists to analyse the content of texts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair found that the overall daily proportion of tweets containing anxiety words remained relatively stable in the weeks leading up to the false alarm, hovering around 3%. Unsurprisingly, that number leapt up on the day of the alert, to about 8%. A detailed look at tweets across the course of the day revealed that the number of anxiety-related tweets began to rise immediately after the alert was sent out — and continued to increase until the all clear was given 38 minutes later, consistent with work suggesting anxiety builds as a threat gets closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the all clear, the proportion of tweets expressing anxiety gradually decreased — but, overall, it took 2 days to drop back down to a stable level. However, this pattern also depended on the tweeters’ baseline anxiety. A “low anxiety” group, whose tweets in the weeks before the alert had contained no anxiety words, took a whole 41 hours to level out after the false alarm; even then, they continued to use more anxiety words than before. In contrast, a “medium anxiety” group, whose baseline tweeting did contain some expressions of anxiety, took just 23 hours to stabilise. Although counterintuitive, this result is in-line with findings that moderate levels of past adverse experiences &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/22/for-some-experiencing-trauma-may-act-as-a-form-of-cognitive-training-that-increases-their-mental-control/&quot;&gt;may boost resilience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally — and unexpectedly — a small “high anxiety” group actually made &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; tweets containing anxiety words after the alert. The authors suggest this could reflect a change of perspective brought on by the threat of death and destruction.  “Users in the high prealert anxiety group may have recognized how much worse things could have been had the missile threat been real,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the extent to which the content of tweets is a valid measure in psychological research &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/23/are-tweets-a-goldmine-for-psychologists-or-just-a-lot-of-noise-researchers-clash-over-the-meaning-of-social-media-data/&quot;&gt;is a matter of some debate&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter users are not representative of the population more broadly, for instance, a limitation the authors acknowledge. Some recent research has also suggested that a person’s use of emotion-related words &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/29/people-who-use-more-happy-words-are-not-necessarily-happier-an-awkward-finding-for-language-based-emotion-research/&quot;&gt;isn’t necessarily a good indication of their actual subjective feelings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the results provide some of the first real-world evidence that — for most people — anxiety is heightened for some time after a false alarm. “Our results reveal how potently frightening a crisis period can be and highlight how intense experiences like this may have lasting effects,” the authors write, stressing the need for agencies to increase outreach and ensure residents receive fast, accurate information when false alarms occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343186&quot;&gt;This is not a drill: Anxiety on Twitter following the 2018 Hawaii false missile alert.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Microdosing” psychedelic drugs involves regularly taking amounts so tiny that they don’t impair a person’s normal functioning, but — it’s claimed — subtly enhance wellbeing, concentration and creativity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/17/rare-systematic-study-of-the-effects-of-microdosing-psychedlics-finds-benefits-but-not-of-the-kind-that-users-most-expect/&quot;&gt;In May, for example, the Digest reported on a study&lt;/a&gt; that found hints of reduced stress and increased emotional intensity among people who microdosed LSD and psilocybin, from ‘magic’ mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we also stressed that there has been little research into the technique — and now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881119857204&quot;&gt;review of the field&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt; concludes that while the popularity of microdosing has exploded over the past eight years, knowledge about what it actually does remains patchy and anecdotal. In fact, there are still far more questions about the technique than answers, write Kim Kuypers at Maastricht University, and her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37630&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, the team lays out what has been established so far — and also the key unknowns. First: what is a microdose, anyway? When it comes to LSD or the active ingredients from magic mushrooms, there is no agreed scientific consensus, though a microdose is often defined as approximately one-tenth to one-twentieth of a recreational dose. However, since there’s significant variability in the level of psilocybin in a magic mushroom, microdosing by weight of dried mushroom could lead to a huge variation in actual doses taken each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most studies to date have also generally lumped together people who self-identify as microdosers into a single group. But there’s a lot of variation in how microdosers schedule their consumption. In a 2011 book that had a huge influence on the take-up of the technique, James Fadiman suggested two consecutive days of dosing followed by two non-dosing days. However, some people take small doses every weekday, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/22/7/426/5509881&quot;&gt;one recent survey of microdosers&lt;/a&gt; found that half had come up with their own schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations in the actual doses that are consumed, and how often they are taken, make it hard to draw conclusions from studies that explore effects reported by microdosers, the team note. Improvements in energy, mood, cognition, concentration, stress management, creativity, spiritual awareness and productivity have all been frequently reported in surveys of microdosers. However, “all of these reports are confounded by the lack of certainty relating to the actual dose used, or indeed the provenance of the active ingredient, and the absence of placebo conditions,” Kuypers and her colleagues write. (The study published in May that found impacts on stress and emotional intensity suffered from all these drawbacks.) Anecdotal reports may not play out in controlled trials: for example, the team notes that to date, no placebo-controlled study has found statistically significant effects of microdosing on creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, though single active doses of drugs like psilocybin are considered to be relatively safe, it’s still unclear whether repeated small doses carry additional risks. For instance, psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) binds to a serotonin receptor that plays a role in heart function, and some drugs that act on this receptor, including the diet medication Phen/Fen, were pulled from the market after heart complications and fatalities. Future work should test whether multiple microdoses of psilocin have negative effects on the heart, the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essential safety-testing aside, much more gold-standard, placebo-controlled research into the effects of microdosing is required, the team argues, as well as a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind any effects. For now, Kuypers says, “there is a lack of scientific proof that microdosing is indeed effective”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881119857204&quot;&gt;Microdosing psychedelics: More questions than answers? An overview and suggestions for future research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_162-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix recently edited the controversial suicide scene from its widely popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://netflix.com/13reasonswhy&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series, entirely deleting the protagonist Hannah’s graphic death. The scene in question has been the center of ongoing debate since its release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-profile suicide (even a fictional one) can actually lead to an observed increase in suicidal behavior in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many mental health advocates, this decision will be a welcome move for one very important reason – &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1943-278X.1989.tb00363.x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suicide can be contagious&lt;/a&gt;. What this means is that a high-profile suicide (even a fictional one) can actually lead to an observed increase in suicidal behavior in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that the media can play a formative role in influencing suicide contagion where sensational and glorified coverage can contribute to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c5841&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; prevalence of suicide among vulnerable individuals. Impressionable youth can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764202250670&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;especially vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; to contagion via sensational portrayals of suicide. In fact, recent studies have shown negative suicide outcomes associated with the release of &lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856719302886&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suicide spikes in youth&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5820689/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rise in internet searches about suicide and self-harm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having observed the ensuing debate surrounding &lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt;, we decided to examine how the series was reported across assorted Canadian newspapers. This analysis was important, as sensational and glorified coverage is shown to contribute to the increased prevalence of suicide contagion. Conversely, responsible coverage can also act to raise awareness and reduce associated negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, we found that the newspapers had a high-level of adherence to key guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, we gathered articles from best-selling newspapers following the launch of the series. We then assessed whether these articles adhered to suicide reporting guidelines, and looked at the major topics and issues discussed within them. Overall, we found that the articles manifested a high-level of adherence to key guidelines. For example, almost 90% of articles did not go into detail about the method of Hannah’s suicide, a practice shown to be helpful in preventing &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.170698&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contagion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, journalists tended to refrain from using archaic and inappropriate language. For example, only 15% used the word “commit” – a discouraged term that implies suicide is a crime. Additionally, we found almost half of the articles actively discussed wider social issues associated with suicide and/or included quotes from mental health professionals. Articles such as these provided valuable context, leading to more considerate and responsible coverage of an inherently sensitive topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 1 in 4 articles included helpful information for readers who may be in distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, there was some room for improvement. Only 1 in 4 articles included helpful information for readers who may be in distress, such as a suicide hotline number. This has previously been identified as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20807970&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;important component of suicide reporting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this research showed the media applied a much-needed critical lens when discussing the series and its implications for youth suicide, involving praise and criticism in equal measure. Common criticisms included the gratuitously explicit suicide scene in the final episode, and its potentially harmful impact on already vulnerable viewers. Common praises included its ability to promote dialogue and awareness about youth issues such as bullying, sexual assault, substance use, and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No public health issue has been solved by silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mere fact that this debate has persisted since the release of the series is inherently positive. Society should not shy away from discussing suicide. Silence can perpetuate stigma and reduce rates of help-seeking behavior among vulnerable individuals. No public health issue has been solved by silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt; kick-started conversations about mental health and youth suicide previously not discussed. For this, we should be grateful. However, the suicide scene was contrary to all guidelines about suicide portrayal with its gratuitously explicit depiction of the protagonist’s suicide. Thus, we should also be grateful for its deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the Canadian news media acted in a socially responsible manner; using the series as a point of considered discussion about youth suicide, and closely following common guidelines on suicide reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good news. And so is the decision to delete the scene of Hannah’s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Netflix we say, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2019-08-13T08:27:17+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The NEST simulator&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/images/20190813-nest-logo.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of work and testing, NEST 2.18.0 and 2.16.0 are now both available
for use on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;. The docs have also been updated to include complete
instructions on how to install and use these tools:
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/nest/&quot;&gt;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/nest/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few quick FAQs for your convenience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do I use NEST on NeuroFedora?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only takes two steps to install NEST using &lt;code&gt;dnf&lt;/code&gt; (the default package manager):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and run (optionally install) a &quot;live&quot; Fedora Workstation image from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;https://getfedora.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install NEST 2.18.0: Run &lt;code&gt;sudo dnf install python3-nest&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do I use version 2.16.0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.16.0 is provided as a &quot;module&quot;. To install the 2.16.0 version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and run (optionally install) a &quot;live&quot; Fedora Workstation image from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;https://getfedora.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install NEST 2.16.0: Run &lt;code&gt;sudo dnf module install nest:2.16.0&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that only one version of NEST can be installed at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Does NEST in NeuroFedora include MPI support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yes---variants built with both MPICH and OpenMPI are available to use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Does NEST in NeuroFedora include libneurosim/MUSIC/CSA: support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of them yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libneurosim: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MUSIC: No (under review: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/28&quot;&gt;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/28&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

The question seems simple enough. “A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia definition of hallucination&quot;&gt;hallucination&lt;/a&gt; is a perception in the absence of external stimulus that has qualities of real perception. Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space.” When we think of visual hallucinations, we often think of trippy colorful images induced by psychedelic drugs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/hallucinogens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hallucinogens&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are &lt;b&gt;dreams&lt;/b&gt; hallucinations? How about visual &lt;b&gt;imagery&lt;/b&gt;? Optical &lt;b&gt;illusions&lt;/b&gt; of motion from viewing a non-moving pattern? No, no, and no (according to this narrow definition). Hallucinations are subjective and inaccessible to others, much as my recent posts discussed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Aphantasia&quot;&gt;presence or absence of visual imagery&lt;/a&gt; in individual humans. However, people can tell us what they're seeing (unlike animals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visual hallucinations can occur in &lt;a href=&quot;http://medicinainterna.net.pe/sites/default/files/Desordenes%20psicoticos.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;psychotic disorders&lt;/a&gt; such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, although auditory hallucinations are more common in those conditions. Visual hallucinations are more often associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Among patients with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2009.62&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;, 33% to 75% experience visual hallucinations, usually related to dopaminergic or anticholinergic drug therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, hallucinations in &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12264-019-00341-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dementia with Lewy Bodies&lt;/a&gt; (DLB) are diagnostic of the disease, and not related to pharmacological treatment. “Recurrent complex visual hallucinations ... are typically well-formed,  often  consisting of figures, such as people or animals.” The cause may be related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Lewy bodies are abnormal aggregates of protein that develop inside neurons&quot;&gt;pathology&lt;/a&gt; in subcortical visual structures such  as the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, rather than the visual cortex itself. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763418308984&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more specific hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; is that loss of α7 nicotinic receptors in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(14)00815-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;may have a complex relationship with arousal and cognitive function&quot;&gt;thalamic reticular nucleus&lt;/a&gt; could lead to hallucinations in DLB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visual hallucinations are also caused by certain types of visual impairment, e.g. age-related &lt;a href=&quot;https://nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt;,  which leads to the loss of central vision. Damage to the macular portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10885/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;retina&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=&quot;https://nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cause people to “see”&lt;/a&gt; simple patterns of colors or shapes that aren't there, or even images of people, animals, flowers, planets, and scary figures. Individuals with CBS know that the hallucinations aren't real, but they're distressing nonetheless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1PbbZc2N2c/XVBit7IsrzI/AAAAAAAAM6U/EFWKGqfbX2YguhdMctpuEdqrQp3RMF3EACLcBGAs/s1600/Charles%2BBonnet%2Bhallucination.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;405&quot; data-original-width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1PbbZc2N2c/XVBit7IsrzI/AAAAAAAAM6U/EFWKGqfbX2YguhdMctpuEdqrQp3RMF3EACLcBGAs/s400/Charles%2BBonnet%2Bhallucination.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;image from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macularsociety.org/visual-hallucinations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Macular Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why are you discussing DLB and CBS here,” you might ask, “because these conditions don't involve abnormal stimulation of the visual cortex.” I brought them up because visual  hallucinations in humans can occur for any number of reasons, not just from manipulation of highly specific cell types in primary visual cortex (which only occurs in optogenetic experiments with animals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;hey look there's a new opto thing must be Thursday&lt;/div&gt;— Mark Baxter 🐵🏳️‍🌈 (@markgbaxter) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markgbaxter/status/1151972066536693764?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 18, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Electrical Stimulation Studies in Humans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A typical starting point here would be Wilder Penfield and the history of surgical epileptology, but I'll skip ahead to the modern day. Patients with intractable epilepsy present teams of neurosurgeons,  neurologists, neurophysiologists, and neuroscience researchers with a unique  opportunity to probe the inner workings of the human brain. Stimulating and recording from regions thought to be the seizure focus (or origin) guide neurosurgeons to the precise tissue to remove, and data acquired from neighboring brain bits is used to make inferences about neural function and electrophysiological mechanisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CTEz9yXeadk/XVBobFpt4MI/AAAAAAAAM6k/pVuI1sqleO8lSfYyQjRatUrgwab66Ic-gCEwYBhgL/s1600/epilepsy%2Bsurgical%2Bteam.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; title=&quot;generic surgical epileptology team in the OR&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;486&quot; data-original-width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CTEz9yXeadk/XVBobFpt4MI/AAAAAAAAM6k/pVuI1sqleO8lSfYyQjRatUrgwab66Ic-gCEwYBhgL/s320/epilepsy%2Bsurgical%2Bteam.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An exciting study by Dr. Joseph Parzivi and colleagues (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/43/14915&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;) stimulated regions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusiform_face_area&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;face-specific or altered by expertise? you decide...&quot;&gt;fusiform face area&lt;/a&gt; (FFA) in the inferior temporal cortex while a patient was undergoing surgical monitoring. Two FFA subregions were identified using both fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ibz25rWMhdU/XVCEnc2Ml0I/AAAAAAAAM64/0NnJ5vL-JiYpReZ0IDfPJRdod4b-3UIYACLcBGAs/s1600/ECoG%2Band%2BfMRI%2Bof%2BFFA.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;810&quot; data-original-width=&quot;999&quot; height=&quot;323&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ibz25rWMhdU/XVCEnc2Ml0I/AAAAAAAAM64/0NnJ5vL-JiYpReZ0IDfPJRdod4b-3UIYACLcBGAs/s400/ECoG%2Band%2BfMRI%2Bof%2BFFA.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location of the face-selective regions converged across ECoG and fMRI studies that presented various stimuli and recorded brain responses in the FFA and nearby regions (1 = posterior fusiform; 2 = medial fusiform). Then the investigators stimulated these two focal points while the patient viewed faces, objects, and photos of famous faces and places. Electrical brain stimulation (EBS) of the FFA produced visual distortions while the patient viewed real faces. Sham stimulation, and EBS of nearby regions, did not produce these perceptual distortions. The article included a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/43/14915.long#media-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of the experiment, which is worth watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GeBhfcp4qns/XVCJkoHydwI/AAAAAAAAM7Q/74fDWxypNfIZ4B86_Q7rBawy5QbuJY3SQCLcBGAs/s1600/Your%2Bface%2Bmetamorphosed_Parvizi%2Bstudy.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;485&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GeBhfcp4qns/XVCJkoHydwI/AAAAAAAAM7Q/74fDWxypNfIZ4B86_Q7rBawy5QbuJY3SQCLcBGAs/s400/Your%2Bface%2Bmetamorphosed_Parvizi%2Bstudy.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217304069&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Another patient&lt;/a&gt; viewed pictures of faces during FFA stimulation and reported the persistence of facial images once they were gone, and the mixing of facial features, but no distortions (this is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palinopsia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;palinopsia&lt;/a&gt;). A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24944263&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;third study&lt;/a&gt; induced the scary phenomenon of seeing yourself (self-face hallucination, or autoscopic hallucination), upon EBS of a non-FFA region (right medial occipitoparietal cortex). A video of this experiment is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwOoqkLwL40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But wait,” you say, “you've been describing complex visual hallucinations and distortions of the face because the EBS was in higher-order visual areas that are specialized for faces. What happens when you stimulate primary visual cortex?” The answer is less exciting (but not unexpected): &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phosphenes&lt;/a&gt;, those non-specific images of light that appear when you close your eyes and press on your eyeballs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627316308467&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Winawer &amp;amp; Parvizi, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). These can be mapped retinotopically according to their location in the visual field. {also see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/53/2/99/314429&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1930 article&lt;/a&gt; by Foerster &amp;amp; Penfield:&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Stimulation of the occipital pole in area 17 produces an attack which is ushered in by an optic aura such as light, flames, stars, usually in the opposite visual field.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But EBS of primary visual cortex is a coarse instrument. Here's where the latest refinements in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;optogenetics&lt;/a&gt; finally enter the picture (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw5202&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marshel et al., 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zAiYD6GdOO0/XVCrnq9GSTI/AAAAAAAAM7c/mtvfiRcHGQEHdWAz7zvwa50fGTo7JAB_wCLcBGAs/s1600/opto%2B1%2B2%2B3%2B4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;897&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1296&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zAiYD6GdOO0/XVCrnq9GSTI/AAAAAAAAM7c/mtvfiRcHGQEHdWAz7zvwa50fGTo7JAB_wCLcBGAs/s400/opto%2B1%2B2%2B3%2B4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won't attempt to cover the complex and novel techniques in Panel 1 and Panel 2 above. So I'll quote others who rave about what a breakthrough they are (and they are): &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WiringTheBrain/status/1152170635394715648&quot;&gt;amazing work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MartinVetterli/status/1159729114682658817&quot;&gt;incredible breakthrough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anne_churchland/status/1153660357879222277&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key advances in current paper include multiSLM to stimulate neurons based on function, and a red-shifted opsin allowing simultaneous 2p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And one day (hypothetically speaking), I'd like to present more than direct quotes and my cartoonish version of the optogenetic ensemble and behavioral training methods. But today isn't that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Using ChRmine [&lt;i&gt;a fancy new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opsin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] together with custom holographic devices to create arbitrarily specified light  patterns [&lt;i&gt;horizontally or vertically drifting gratings&lt;/i&gt;], we were able to measure naturally occurring large-scale 3D  ensemble activity patterns during visual experience and then replay  these natural patterns at the level of many individually specified  cells. We found that driving specific ensembles of cells on the basis of  natural stimulus-selectivity resulted in recruitment of a broad network  with dynamical patterns corresponding to those elicited by real visual  stimuli and also gave rise to the correctly selective behaviors even in  the absence of visual input.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Briefly, the investigators captured patterns of activity in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/know-your-brain-primary-visual-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;primary visual cortex&quot;&gt;V1&lt;/a&gt; layer 2/3 neurons and layer 5 neurons that responded to horizontal or vertical gratings, and then played back the same patterns to those neurons in the absence of a visual stimulus. There goes the coarseness of EBS-induced phosphenes in humans... But obviously, the one great advantage of human studies is that your subjects can tell you what they see. Nonetheless, everyone wants to say that laser-activated nerve cells cause the mice to hallucinate vertical bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really happened is that mice were trained to discriminate between horizontal and vertical gratings. The task required them to respond to the vertical, but not the horizontal. After training, visual stimulation with gratings was compared to optogenetic stimulation of classifier-identified neural ensembles in the absence of gratings. How well did the mice perform with optogenetic-only stimulation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modified from Fig. 5 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw5202&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marshel et al., 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(A)&lt;/b&gt; Discrimination performance during visual-only stimulation (&lt;b&gt;black&lt;/b&gt;) and tuned-ensemble stimulation (&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;) over several weeks. &lt;b&gt;(B)&lt;/b&gt; Discrimination performance for tuned-ensemble stimulation versus visual trials (P &amp;gt; 0.1 paired t test, two-tailed, n = 112 sessions across five mice). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HFvgB_NLTKY/XVDGpKr4yeI/AAAAAAAAM7o/-W5tTKYgaNosKNse6Iw0Q_AtofhnFAscwCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig%2B5A%2526B%2Blarge.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;270&quot; data-original-width=&quot;825&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HFvgB_NLTKY/XVDGpKr4yeI/AAAAAAAAM7o/-W5tTKYgaNosKNse6Iw0Q_AtofhnFAscwCLcBGAs/s400/Fig%2B5A%2526B%2Blarge.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually the mice did just about as well on the discrimination task with optogenetic stimulation of the horizontally or vertically-tuned neurons, compared to when the horizontal or vertical stimuli were actually presented. Were these mice “hallucinating” vertical gratings?  Or did they merely learn to respond when a specific neural ensemble was activated? Isn't this somewhat like neurofeedback? During training, the mice were rewarded or punished based on their correct or incorrect response to the “vertical” ensemble stimulation. They can't tell us what, if anything, they saw under those conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the authors themselves noted the following limitation, that “mice initially required some training involving paired  optogenetic and visual stimuli before optogenetic activation alone  sufficed to drive behavioral discrimination.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw5202&quot;&gt;Marshel et al.&lt;/a&gt; correctly invoked the “it takes a village” explanation that many other cortical and subcortical regions are required to generate a full natural visual percept. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My frustration with the press coverage stems from inaccurate language and overblown interpretations.&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[So what else is new?]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/science/mice-brain-hallucinations.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why Are These Mice Hallucinating?

And it’s not because they’ve been given drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With new laser technology, scientists &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaw5202&quot;&gt;have triggered specific hallucinations in mice&lt;/a&gt; by switching on a few neurons with beams of light. The researchers reported the results on Thursday in the journal Science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technique promises to provide clues to how the billions of neurons in the brain make sense of the environment. Eventually the research also may lead to new treatments for psychological disorders, including uncontrollable hallucinations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/07/stanford-team-stimulates-neurons-to-induce-particular-perception.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stanford press release&lt;/a&gt; doesn't use “hallucination”  in the title, but a few are sprinkled throughout the text for dramatic effect: “&lt;i&gt;Hallucinations are spooky&lt;/i&gt;” and “&lt;i&gt;Hallucinating mice&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should we classify the following as a spooky hallucination: Optical stimulation of 20 vertical bar neurons in behaviorally trained mice who then perform the task as if the drifting vertical gratings were present in their visual field. I would say no. To be fair, in the &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; paper the authors used the word “hallucinations” only once, and it wasn't to describe mouse percepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Studying specific sensory experiences with ensemble stimulation under different conditions may help advance development of therapeutic strategies . . . for neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More broadly, the ability to track and control large cellular-resolution ensembles over time during learning, and to selectively link cells and ensembles together into behaviorally relevant circuitry, may have important implications for studying and leveraging plasticity underlying learning and memory in health and disease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm focusing on only one small aspect of the study, albeit the one that grabs media attention. The results were highly informative in many other ways, and I do not want to detract from the monumental technical achievements of the research team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This is a terrific resource, with loads of information, additional artistic renderings, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macularsociety.org/sites/default/files/CBS_eBook_Web.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eBook&lt;/a&gt;, and a must-see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNhnhD8ecGY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There's no escaping Penfield...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; See Appendix for expert opinion, since I am &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; an expert...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foerster O, Penfield W.

 &lt;span&gt;Open access to research papers in STM journals has always been a controversial topic. When the focus shifts to humanities research, and to monographs, the temperature rises still further – as evidenced by this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eve.gd/2019/07/24/the-british-academy-response-misrepresents-plan-s-and-oa/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;emotionally charged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;post by OA advocate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbk.ac.uk/english/our-staff/full-time-academic-staff/martin-eve&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Martin Eve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in response to a British Academy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/A_commentary_by_the_British_Academy_on_final_Plan_S-July_2019.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;document on the European OA initiative Plan S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQU_R1yib4k/XUgRylYYo6I/AAAAAAAAmqQ/eBq17GoQFD8t0iplP7phq1Vj-k1DqyF6QCLcBGAs/s1600/C%2526C%2BLanchester.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1554&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1214&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQU_R1yib4k/XUgRylYYo6I/AAAAAAAAmqQ/eBq17GoQFD8t0iplP7phq1Vj-k1DqyF6QCLcBGAs/s200/C%2526C%2BLanchester.jpg&quot; width=&quot;155&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: xx-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: xx-small;&quot;&gt;Image from Edith Hall's new book *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is open access so contentious? In large part, I think, because although OA began as a bottom-up revolution it was never widely embraced by researchers. However, OA advocates managed to persuade governments, funders and institutions that their colleagues should be compelled to embrace open access. This has seen a series of ever more stringent OA mandates being imposed on researchers, increasing the bureaucratic burden on them (amongst other things). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monographs are a particularly contested area because of their length, their narrative form, and the licensing issues that this raises. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has not helped that OA advocates promised open access would reduce the costs of scholarly communication. In reality, costs have risen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This last point is particularly troublesome in the UK context as OA policies have been introduced without providing the necessary funding to support them. As a result, researchers can discover that they have been mandated to make their work open access but cannot afford to pay the article-processing charge (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://libraryguides.helsinki.fi/apc&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;APC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) needed if they want to satisfy the government’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.rcuk.ac.uk/2012/10/24/rcuk-open-access-policy-our-preference-for-gold/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;preference for gold OA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This has been a challenge even for researchers at wealthy and prestigious institutions. Last year, for instance, Oxford University library had to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/2018/01/10/oxfords-rcuk-open-access-block-grant-update-no-funds-remaining/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;inform faculty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that its OA fund had been exhausted and so they should delay submitting to journals until it had been replenished.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the same time, the bureaucracy surrounding OA compliance has become so complex that universities have had to recruit legions of support staff to interpret and manage the escalating number of policies (some of which have proved contradictory). Indeed, such is the complexity now that even specialist support staff can struggle to decode the rules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short, the UK OA policy environment is far too complex, and it is seriously underfunded. For researchers, this is frustrating and depressing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;No one knows this better than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/edith-hall&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Edith Hall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a professor of Classics at King’s College London.

The book’s theme is the historic exclusion of the poor from education in the Greek and Roman Classics. To not make her work open access, Hall felt, would be an act of hypocrisy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moreover, since the organisation that funded the research in the book – The Arts &amp;amp; Humanities Research Council (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrc.ukri.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AHRC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) – has had an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrc.ukri.org/about/policies/openaccess/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;open access policy in place since 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;it seemed the correct thing to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AHRC was until recently one of the funding bodies of the umbrella organisation Research Councils UK (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Councils_UK&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RCUK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), which itself has had an open access policy in place &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.rcuk.ac.uk/2012/10/24/rcuk-open-access-policy-our-preference-for-gold/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;since 2012&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. RCUK’s role has now moved to UK Research and Innovation (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Research_and_Innovation&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UKRI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), which has inherited both the RCUK policy and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/04/01/hefce-open-access-ref-gamechanger/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2014 OA policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the Higher Education Council for England (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Funding_Council_for_England&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HEFCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). HEFCE manages the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Excellence_Framework&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research Excellence Framework&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;and the future funding of Hall’s department depends on her and her colleagues submitting their work for REF assessment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, Hall’s work is subject to several different OA policies, all of which were introduced with the aim of making publicly funded research open access. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;True, only research papers have to be made open access on a mandatory basis today, but all the UK policies recommend and actively encourage researchers to make their monographs open access as well. As the Guidance on Submissions for REF 2021 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ref.ac.uk/media/1092/ref-2019_01-guidance-on-submissions.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;puts it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “The funding bodies [also] encourage institutions to take a proportionate view of the costs and benefits of making other types of outputs (including monographs) available as open access.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complexity aside, the problem these policies face is that they were introduced on the assumption that open access would be less costly than traditional methods, or at least cost neutral. As noted, this has not proved the case. In fact, it was only after it had introduced its OA policy that RCUK realised it had imposed a significant new cost burden on UK universities. In 2013, therefore, it had to provide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2012/11/01/uk-government-stands-up-for-open-access-with-a-10-million-funding-boost/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;additional funding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to research-intensive universities like King’s in order for them to comply, in the form of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukri.org/funding/information-for-award-holders/open-access/open-access-policy/open-access-block-grants/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;annual block grants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to pay for APCs. At the time, it was assumed that this would only need to be a temporary measure, but the money has had to be paid ever since. (King’s 2019/2020 block grant is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukri.org/files/research/2019-2020-block-grant-awards-pdf/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;£686,560&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keen to make her work open access, conscious that OA is now a UK priority, and aware that funding is available to help pay for open access, Hall contacted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/library/researchsupport/index&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at King’s (which manages the RCUK block grant) to ask if they could contribute to the Book Processing Charge (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://libraryguides.helsinki.fi/apc&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;BPC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) she would need to pay to make her book OA. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To her joy, Research Support replied that they would be happy to fund the full cost of making the book OA (£10,000). Explaining why they were providing the money, Research Support cited the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/documents/rcukopenaccesspolicy-pdf/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RCUK Policy on Open Access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Although RCUK’s open access policy does not require mandatory OA for monographs or books, they said, it does encourage “authors of such material to consider making them Open Access where possible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, they said, the RCUK policy states that research organisations “may use the block grant in the manner they consider will best deliver the RCUK Policy on Open Access, as long as the primary purpose to support the payment of APCs is fulfilled.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Confident that the funding was now in place to make their book OA, Hall and Stead signed an open access agreement with Routledge/Taylor &amp;amp; Francis (RTF) and began writing up their research. When the book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s text was finally accepted by RFT Hall emailed Research Support to ask where the publisher should send its invoice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research Support replied, however, that as too many calls are now being made on the block grant, they could no longer honour their commitment to pay. When Hall questioned this change of heart, she was informed that – contrary to what Research Support had told her at the time she applied for the subvention – it was not actually permitted to use money from RCUK block grants to pay BPCs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alarmed that if it did not go into production immediately their book would not be published in time to be eligible for the all-important 2021 REF, Hall and Stead concluded they had no choice but to ask RTF to rewrite the contract along traditional lines and accept that their book would not be open access after all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Wider significance?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hall’s experience has been demoralising and frustrating. But does it have any wider significance? I think so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s recall that when the open access movement was founded – at the meeting of the 2002 Budapest Open Access Initiative (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;BOAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) – the resulting declaration stated (inter alia) that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Removing access barriers to [the scholarly] literature will accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This democratic, upbeat vision is a far cry from the expensive, oppressive and bureaucratic environment that surrounds open access in the UK today. And one can reasonably assume that many other UK researchers have been experiencing similar frustrations to Hall. This can only alienate them from the practice and principles of open access, and so delay the transformation to OA the UK government wants to see. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is, however, a larger and more pressing question we have to ask: Is the open access strategy currently being pursued in the UK affordable, particularly as the government focuses its attention on monographs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clearly driven by settled policy rather than financial considerations the UK is now determined to press ahead and mandate OA for monographs. Last year &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://re.ukri.org/about-us/our-people/steven-hill/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Steven Hill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Director of Research at UKRI &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebookseller.com/insight/oa-requirement-monographs-will-benefit-society-says-hill-747196&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Bookseller&lt;/i&gt;that for REF2027 the current policies on open access as applied to journal articles would be extended to encompass monographs and other “long form outputs”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But how much will this cost? How will it be funded? This question has led to some anguished deliberation, by both publishers and researchers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2017, for instance, the Pro-Vice Dean Research (Impact and Innovation) at King’s College, Simon Tanner, published a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://simon-tanner.blogspot.com/2017/06/gold-is-dead-model-for-open-access-books.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;blog post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; entitled &lt;i&gt;Gold is a dead model for Open Access Books. &lt;/i&gt;In the post, he said that Book Processing Charges in a Gold OA environment, “would be utterly unsustainable in a future OA mandated REF environment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In reaching this conclusion Tanner calculated that there were 11,861 named submitters to Panel D (Arts and Humanities) for REF2014, with 8,513 books. He explained: “So we have 8,513 books submitted to the REF2014 and probably a similar number to the next one as well. The top 3 most book submitting universities were University of Oxford (511), University of Cambridge (344) and King’s College London (245).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tanner added that BPCs range from between £3,500 to £11,000 per book. As a result, he said, “The maths don’t look good if these figures continued into a new OA mandated REF environment. At the lower end (say £3,000 per book) the figures are scary, at the upper end (say £10,000 per book) the figures are impossible to sustain or contemplate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This would mean, he said, that Oxford’s 511 books would cost between £1.5 million and £5.1 million to submit to the REF, Cambridge’s 344 books would cost between £1 million and £3.4 million to submit, and King’s 245 books would cost between £0.7 million and £2.5 million to submit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If Tanner’s estimates are right, and UKRI does introduce an OA monograph mandate, the UK could face a bill of between £25 and £85 million (using the REF2014 figures). Others might question these figures, but even OA advocate Martin Eve acknowledges that there are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.392/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;significant funding challenges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And this would be on top of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukri.org/files/funding/oa/rcuk-apc-returns-analysis-2016-and-2017-pdf/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;millions of pounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; it is already paying to fund journal APCs, a figure that has increased by over 50% since the payments began in 2013. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, the hope is that universities will be able to turn their journal licensing contracts with publishers into “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/04/23/transformative-agreements/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;transformative agreements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;”. This would see the costs of reading subscription journal content and OA publication charges combined and (UKRI must hope) obviate the need to continue paying block grants. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, this requires the co-operation of publishers and has the potential for being highly disruptive – as researchers at the University of California have discovered following their library’s decision to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-uc-elsevier-20190711-story.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;walk away&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from negotiations over such an agreement with the world’s largest scholarly publisher Elsevier. In response, Elsevier has pulled the plug, leaving faculty without access to newly published papers in thousands of Elsevier journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even if this strategy eventually proves successful for journals, it is unclear how a similar transition process would work for monographs. For this reason, doubtless, UKRI recently &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://re.ukri.org/news-events-publications/news/re-awards-2-2m-to-project-to-improve-open-access-publishing/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;awarded £2.2m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to a project intended “to make more, and better, use of open access book publishing”. But is there really time to reinvent the monograph publishing landscape before REF2027? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One model that has gained traction is the so-called crowdfunding solution in which libraries combine funds to “unlock” books and make them open access. But there are problems with this model and – as is evident from recent criticism of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knowledge Unlatched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (e.g. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.openbookpublishers.com/open-book-publishers-statement-on-knowledge-unlatched-and-the-open-research-library/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/10/03/knowledge-unlatched-failed-transparency-and-the-commercialisation-of-open-access-book-publishing/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) – there are also unintended consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/7/3/55&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; draws attention to some of the problems of the crowdfunding model. It also points out that the ongoing efforts to agree transformative agreements with journal publishers, the current focus of UKRI on Plan S, and the large amounts of money already being sucked from the system by journals, pose a big threat to implementing such a model. As the authors put it, “Currently, the focus of libraries and research funders is on journals rather than books. Therefore, Plan S could be a threat as well as other changes in science policy orientation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It seems to me that there are two underlying and connected problems here. There is an abiding assumption that open access can reduce the costs of scholarly publishing and a continuing desire to press ahead with policy changes without thinking through the cost implications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s as if OA advocates and funders believed that costs can be magically wished away. The truth is that costs do not disappear with open access. Moreover, publishers are not going to willingly lower their prices, and market forces are not sufficient to force them to do so, if only because STM researchers are always going to want to publish in prestigious journals and humanities researchers are always going to want to publish with prestigious imprints. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;True, high-minded statements like The Declaration on Research Assessment (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DORA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) effectively seek to force researchers to abandon this practice (as does Plan S) but this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20181107234431569&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;raises issues of academic freedom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;and leaves researchers more vulnerable to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;predatory publishing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short, while King’s College clearly failed Hall in her attempts to publish her new book open access, the larger failing here is a failure of the UK government and UK funders. They have yet to develop a coherent or sustainable strategy for moving to an open-access environment, even as they insist on pressing ahead with new OA policies. This suggests that individuals like Hall can expect the situation to get worse before it gets better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there is a little good news to end with: RTF agreed to insert a clause in the new contract with Hall and Stead to allow their book to made open access after a three-year embargo, for a reduced BPC (£3,000). And King’s has agreed to pay the fee. The book will, therefore, become freely available to the public in 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Below is a Q&amp;amp;A with Hall.

I was educated entirely at the British taxpayers’ expense and don’t think they should have to pay commercial publishers for the results of that education, especially when my research has been funded by public money. I am unhappy, however, with attempts to impose mandatory OA on HEIs without proper preparation; the result has been chaos. Moreover, the expenses of publishing simply transferred from reader to author.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You and your colleague Henry Stead have a book in print with Routledge called A People’s History of Classics.

Due to the topic of the book, you were very keen to publish it open access.

It seems inappropriate that a book about educational exclusion resulting from poverty should be unavailable to some people who would be excluded from reading it because of the price-tag attached. It is called &lt;i&gt;A People’s History of Classics: Class and Greco-Roman Antiquity in Britain 1689-1939&lt;/i&gt;.

Double weighting occurs where a publication is of such clear high quality that it is worth assuming it will get top marks. But this has yet to be decided by my department.

After checking the various policies, they said they could fund the whole cost of publication from the RCUK block grant because your research had been funded by AHRC. They even cited from the RCUK OA Policy to support that decision. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;EH:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Yes. I was thrilled. I did not expect them to offer to pay the full costs of publishing OA, but they did, and asked that I go back to them as soon as the book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s text was finally and fully accepted for publication. I told my HoD, my colleagues and the public who follow me on social media and was very impressed by the attitude of King’s Research Support towards my request and the project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: When the book was ready you went back to them to ask where the publisher should send the invoice. At that point, you were told that the commitment to pay had been withdrawn (although no one had contacted you to tell you as much when the decision was made). Can you explain what happened, your understanding of why the commitment to pay was withdrawn, why you think you were not told that it had been withdrawn, and what the implications of this subsequent decision were for you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;EH:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The offer seems to have slipped off their radar altogether. The administrator from whom I had received the emailed commitment had left KCL.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I was shocked to be let down like this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You have a large number of Twitter and Facebook followers, and you regularly publish a blog.

Other academics need to be aware that promises of funding of OA for their books and articles may be withdrawn at any time.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think it is perfectly reasonable for OA to be mandatory (and of course adequate funds to be given to HEIs to cover this) in the case of academic publications where the research was directly funded by public money, as this book’s research was funded by the AHRC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The AHRC bought out some of my time from KCL to conduct this research and so it was not done, for example, as overtime at weekends. Some of my other books are written in the evenings and at weekends, especially the more ‘popular’, accessible trade books.

If it has done so, I asked, could I be given a link to that data? I was promised an answer in the next day or so. It is now several weeks since then and I have not had my questions answered. I assume King’s is sending annual reports on how it is spending the block grant to UKRI.

When she completed the book and asked for the publisher to be paid, however, she was told that RCUK does not allow block grant funds to be used for BPCs. I must assume that both these interpretations of the RCUK policy cannot be correct, or might it be that it is possible to pick and choose different parts of the RCUK policy to suit one’s purpose? If not the latter, is it you that misunderstood the RCUK policy when you agreed to the subvention or was the subsequent decision not to honour the commitment a misunderstanding of the policy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;HC:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; In December 2015 the Research Support team responded to Professor Hall’s request for support in making her forthcoming monograph OA, advising that we could cover the costs of the publisher’s OA book processing charge (BPC) from our RCUK OA funds. We thereby made a soft commitment in the expectation that an invoice would be shortly forthcoming. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were aware that RCUK’s OA policy did and does not apply to monographs or books, however their guidance notes say that they encourage such outputs to be made OA and permit research organisations to use the block grant in the manner they consider will best deliver the RCUK Policy on open access, as long as the primary purpose to support the payment of publisher open access fees [is fulfilled]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The original enquiry was almost 4 years ago. Areas that we would have considered before replying include: whether this was a reasonable thing for the block grant to be spent on, what funds were then uncommitted, what our peers in other UK HEIs were doing. That would have informed our response to Professor Hall. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On review, this may not have been the answer that should have been given, it was a judgement. Having recently spoken with UKRI they clarified they will not allow their block grant to be used to pay for a book to be made open access. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is because of this and no other reason that when Professor Hall contacted the team in June 2019 to say that payment would now be required we responded to advise that unfortunately we would not be able to cover the cost of the BPC from our RCUK/UKRI funds, but would explore all options to try and assist her which we did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;King’s did not change its mind about this. Research Support reviewed what was possible when re-contacted 3 years after being last contacted by Professor Hall, and advised that unfortunately we were not in a position to use RCUK/UKRI funds as we’d originally hoped. We have since been able to secure alternative funds to cover the cost of Professor Hall’s BPC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Why did Research Support not get back to Edith Hall at the time the initial decision was overturned to explain that it had been overturned and that King’s was no longer willing to honour its commitment, rather than wait until the money was requested, when timing (re the REF) was of the essence, and when it was too late to request AHRC to fund the BPC, leaving Hall and her co-author no option but to revert to a traditional all rights reserved contract – despite Hall having repeatedly promised her thousands of Twitter and blog followers that the book would be OA, confident in the knowledge that King’s had agreed to pay the BPC?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;HC:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; There was no decision taken in the intervening years to overturn our previous soft commitment made to Professor Hall in December 2015. The number of requests we have and continue to receive for support with OA funding is in the thousands. We ask researchers to please keep in touch with us during the publication process so as to ensure that finances are available. Since Professor Hall’s previous last contact with us in 2016 we have updated our communications to spell out more clearly that block grant funds are provided on a first come first served basis and only to fund journal articles, they are offered as a soft commitment not reserved indefinitely, with budgets spent annually.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You were at that time the manager of Research Support.

Unfortunately, there are not currently alternative funds to those provided by UKRI and the Wellcome Trust to support open access publishing. We were contacted by Professor Hall at the end of June 2019.

And right now, UKRI is conducting a review in order to establish how this policy decision will be implemented. In light of this it seems inevitable to me that we are about to move to a world in which monographs are published OA and I can see no reasonable alternative to their being funded by means of BPCs.

How many books is King’s currently producing each year and how many of these (if any) are being made available on an OA basis?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;HC:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Information on how many monographs are being published annually by King’s authors is challenging to determine exactly. Approximate numbers in recent years suggest a figure of c.150 to 200 monographs being published pa. Very few of these are being published open access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;[RP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;It might be useful to provide a little more background and context to this discussion. Where a scientist will write a paper and then send it to a journal publisher for consideration, with humanities monographs the author generally does things the other way round: s/he will propose an idea to a publisher before writing the book. The publisher will likely then send that proposal (the book’s topic and how the topic will be dealt with) out for review. Only once the reviews have been provided, and any recommended changes made to the book proposal (assuming the publisher is still willing to proceed), will the author(s) sit down and write the text (of, say, 200,000 words). Sometimes the completed text will also be sent out for further review before the book is finally cleared for publication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;This process takes a lot longer than sending a, say, 5,000-word scientific paper to a journal and waiting for it to be reviewed and published (which can sometimes happen within 3 months), especially when the book author(s) is/ are highly research active and working on several other books and projects simultaneously. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case of the book we are discussing the text was not finally and fully accepted for publication until June this year, which is when Hall contacted Research Support to ask for the promised BPC to be released (on 22nd June). In its initial response, which was not sent until 12th July, Research Support replied that three years is a long time in open access and that the demand on RCUK funds was now significantly higher. (It later added that it was not in any case permitted to use RCUK funds to pay BPCs). Consequently, it suggested that the Faculty of Arts and Humanities be asked for money to pay the BPC. More than a month after Hall made contact (26th July), the Vice Dean Research said that he could not provide the funds either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this point, Hall had no option but to go back to the publisher and ask to revert to a traditional contract. She then negotiated with the publisher an option that would allow the book to be made OA after three years for a greatly reduced BPC. When she asked Research Support if they would pay this reduced fee they agreed. As such, it is not so much that Research Support eventually secured funds to cover the cost of the BPC, but that it secured a considerably lower sum in order for the book to be released after a three-year embargo. The book will not be freely available until 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;With regard to Research Support having offered a “soft” commitment: when Hall was informed that the money would be made available to her she was told, “As you are funded by AHRC we are prepared to fund the whole cost of publication for your monograph from the RCUK block grant.” There was no indication here that the commitment would expire at some point in the future, or that it was “soft” (whatever that might mean). It would have been reasonable for Hall to assume that at that point the commitment was recorded in some file or document somewhere indicating that the BPC had been promised to her. It would now seem, however, that this is not the case and that King’s operates a first come first served system. More precisely, it sounds like a “first to send an invoice” system rather than a “first to be granted a subvention” system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other universities have been making data about how they are spending their block grants freely available on the web (open access) at the same time as they file the reports to RCUK. Sometimes this is as a spreadsheet, sometimes as a complete report – e.g. see the information published by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/17808&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;St Andrews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/queens-university-belfast-rcukukri-open-access-compliance-report-20182019(a41874dc-e4a7-4350-b8e6-8c4ce982276a).html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Queen’s, Belfast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datacompass.lshtm.ac.uk/1115/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;LSHTM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/9386/University%20of%20Edinburgh%20RCUK%20Open%20Access%20Report%202013-14.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/display/80688421?source=2&amp;amp;algorithmId=14&amp;amp;similarToDoc=200198624&amp;amp;similarToDocKey=CORE&amp;amp;recSetID=fcbf1cf9-01a3-45d6-b60b-70dc9d7f0bec&amp;amp;position=2&amp;amp;recommendation_type=same_repo&amp;amp;otherRecs=30729967,80688421,46520707,76992408,35433165&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Strathclyde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/display/76992408?source=2&amp;amp;algorithmId=14&amp;amp;similarToDoc=200198624&amp;amp;similarToDocKey=CORE&amp;amp;recSetID=fcbf1cf9-01a3-45d6-b60b-70dc9d7f0bec&amp;amp;position=4&amp;amp;recommendation_type=same_repo&amp;amp;otherRecs=30729967,80688421,46520707,76992408,35433165&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Imperial College&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/display/35433165?source=2&amp;amp;algorithmId=14&amp;amp;similarToDoc=200198624&amp;amp;similarToDocKey=CORE&amp;amp;recSetID=fcbf1cf9-01a3-45d6-b60b-70dc9d7f0bec&amp;amp;position=5&amp;amp;recommendation_type=same_repo&amp;amp;otherRecs=30729967,80688421,46520707,76992408,35433165&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;LSE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/264341&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cambridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/BLOG-post_Get-to-know-series_KRoot-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: PLOS will be attending the ESA conference in Louisville, Kentucky starting on August 11. Stop by our booth and say hello! Dr. Karen Root, an Academic Editor for &lt;/em&gt;PLOS ONE,&lt;em&gt; will also be in attendance. You can meet her at our booth on Monday, August 12 between 3 and 4pm. Here’s a brief interview with her. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What is your area of study and what are you currently working on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A: I originally began as behavioral ecologist but realized there were real issues in the population that I was studying related to human activities. Conservation biology drew me since it provided a way to utilize my ecological training to directly address some of those issues. My current research focuses on native species and the factors that imperil them, but also on the effects of restoration and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What first drew you into the field?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A: I have always been interested in the natural world around me, especially growing up in an urban center. During college I spent a summer at the Itasca Biological Station and fell in love with field work. In graduate school, I grew to appreciate techniques such as spatial analysis and population modeling that complemented the field studies. Conservation biology is a way to integrate all of these approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Could you share your thoughts on why this type of research is important? How does it affect other areas of research? Other communities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A: I think of myself as a practical ecologist–basic ecological research is important but there are issues that need to be addressed. When I can demonstrate the societal value of my research, I receive more support, collaboration is more likely, and scientists and non-scientists alike are more receptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How long have you been an editor on &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;? What have you enjoyed most about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A: I have only been an editor for a year, but it has been a very interesting experience and I have learned so much more about science communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Why is &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; important to you and the ecology community?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A: I appreciate the inclusivity of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. It is very tempting to focus on one aspect of ecology or a particular subdiscipline but you would miss out on all of the other interesting research out there that can strengthen your own science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What advice would you give to authors in your field who are getting ready to submit their work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A: Read broadly. If I can understand a paper that is not in my area of expertise, then I can learn something important about how to write more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What are you most looking forward to while attending ESA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A: One of my favorite aspects of ESA is the chance to catch up on the latest advances not only in ecological science but also education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are there any trends in your field right now that you’re hoping to learn more about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A: There are so many new ways to communicate about science and become more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Why do you believe in Open Science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A: Problem solving requires cooperation, coordination and large amounts of data to be truly effective. Open Science can facilitate these aspects as well as increase the diversity of participants and disciplines in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/BMCWordle-620x342-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Sports Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-019-0123-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medicine and Rehabiliation – Lights out, let’s dance! An investigation into participation in No Lights, No Lycra and its association with health and wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dancing is a performing art form whereby participants move their body in time to a rhythm (usually music). It is a physical activity that has been associated with improving fitness and physical wellbeing. An activity often enjoyed in childhood, it often falls away as we get older and relatively few people participate once they reach adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11177 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/cheers-204742_1920-300x212.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nolightsnolycra.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;No lights, no lycra (NLNL)&lt;/a&gt; is a global dance community that allows participants to indulge in free form dancing in the dark, providing a non-judgmental, inclusive and drug and alcohol free environment. It’s an activity that has gained popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, Foley &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; have recently looked into the sort of people who participate in this activity. They collected information on their demographic characteristics, physical activity levels, motivations for doing the activity and what impact NLNL has had on their health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This investigation was performed via a self-report online survey where each participant was asked to describe their experiences and motivations. This revealed that NLNL mostly attracts adult women who, by and large, are not particularly fit and have not historically engaged in much organised physical activity before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustrates how an organised physical activity can be modified to appeal to a population that would not have otherwise been interested and highlights the need to understand how such modifications can motivate and maintain the engagement of people who would typically be inactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-4353-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Supporting access to healthcare for refugees and migrants in European countries under particular migratory pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, countries in the European Union (EU) experienced an influx of over a million refugees and migrants; the so-called refugee crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resulted in an increase in migratory pressures; providing care for the most vulnerable groups created some significant challenges. In essence, refugees and migrants frequently found themselves with no effective healthcare. As a response to this, a study was performed by Chiarenza and colleagues to inform the development of a “resource package”, aiming to improve such access. This involved conducting interviews and focus groups in order to collect up-to-date information on the challenges different healthcare provides faced in relation to the refugee crisis, as well as a literature review on barriers to healthcare access and possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11178 alignright&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/humanitarian-aid-939723_1280-300x218.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that the barriers faced by refugees and migrants were due to challenges related to whether they had just arrived to a EU country, were in transit or whether they have reached their final destination. These challenges created, for example, legislative, financial and administrative barriers to healthcare, lack of reliable information on the health status of individuals, lack of knowledge of entitlements and what help was available, and lack of organization and co-ordination between different services. These issues were particularly acute when trying to access mental health, sexual health, child services or victim of violence care services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that working with solutions developed to deal with emergencies often create a system that is both chaotic and fragmented, distracting from the need to develop changes in the EU health system to prevent vulnerable people from accessing healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-019-1706-8&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The role of WhatsApp® in medical education; a scoping review and instructional design model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information technology (IT) has changed many aspects of how we communicate. This, in turn, has had a considerable impact on education, providing the means, for example, to access a wide range of multimedia learning resources. There are questions however surrounding whether there is enough evidence supporting the benefits of using IT tools for medical education and, in particular, whether the advance of learning in medical education is driven more by social behavior and cheap technology than improvement in outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11179 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/whatsapp-3012138_1920-300x225.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman and O’Conner recently performed a scoping review of a popular messaging and voice over IP service, WhatsApp, the aim of which being to see how it is used and evaluated as a tool in medical education. They performed two searches of the published literature, using the term “WhatsApp” as the search term. They discovered that WhatsApp was being used in implementing one of three different strategies – namely educational use with a pre-defined curriculum, educational use without a curriculum, or a primarily non-educational use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some reports of an improvement in the learners knowledge after using WhatsApp as a learning tool, but there was little evidence for any learning theory being used. Coleman and O’Conner have taken the three strategies for WhatsApp use and developed their own model that draws on the Dabbagh and Bannan-Ritland’s exploration-enactment-evaluation learning design framework for online education, from which they propose their own instant messenger design model for medical education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-019-0043-z&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fishing for iodine: what aquatic foraging by bonobos tells us about human evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain development, in particular the expansion of brain tissue and development of advanced cognitive skills are characteristic of human evolution. It has been linked to nutrients that promote such development, including iodine. Rich sources of this critical nutrient can be found primarily in coastal areas. This thus raises the question of how early hominins in continental areas could have met their iodine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to try and answer this question is to study how hominoid primates today are able to source these nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11104 alignright&quot; height=&quot;207&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/06/bonobos-fishingCGB-300x200.png&quot; width=&quot;311&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonobos are only found in the central region of the Congo basin, an area considered to be somewhat iodine deficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hohmann and colleagues measured the mineral content of the fruit, terrestrial and aquatic herbs in the area, which showed that it was the aquatic herbs that contained most iodine and, importantly, two species in particular had iodine concentrations almost equivalent to that found in marine algae. This challenges the assumption that the Congo basin is iodine deficient and shows that it offers natural sources of the nutrient in concentrations high enough to prevent iodine deficiency in hominoids and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
