 &lt;p&gt;While I was busy working an office job and preparing for a web development bootcamp (sorry, PhD… maybe later!) neuroscientists all over the world were busy discovering cool stuff. Like, did you know FDA approved psychedelic therapy trials for depression? Or that we as a humanity managed to start reversing blindness in mice? Or what octopuses do after you give them MDMA? Hopefully you didn’t. But even if you did, read on to find out even more cool things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some really good news. Scientists from the University of Leeds kicked cancer in the balls. Or, more scientifically speaking, aggressive brain tumor cells were forced to self-destruct after being exposed to a specific synthetic chemical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111643&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[1].&lt;/a&gt; Glioblastoma, the cancer in question, is a real bitch -- it is hard to treat and hard to survive. Originally, the authors just wanted to test whether this synthetic molecule would have a therapeutic effect and slow the cancer down; what they got, however, was something even better. The said chemical had a toxic effect on the cancer cells and basically just messed with their mitochondria (powerhouse of the cell!). This shut down the energy supply of the cells and led to their destruction. Moreover, the scientists tested whether this chemical can cross the blood-brain-barrier, a border that separates circulating blood from our precious brain, by first introducing glioblastoma into mice and then injecting them with the chemical. And indeed: it successfully crossed the barrier and decreased the tumor growth by around 50%. Also good to mention that normal brain cells were unaffected by the killer molecule. It is still a long way before human trials are approved but it is extremely promising. In your face, cancer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for everyone's favorite topic of psychedelics (favorite to the extent of me getting mails from random dudes asking where to get DMT… Not the fame I asked for). First off, neuroscientists at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who normally study social behavior of animals decided to go one (or rather hundred) step(s) further and to give MDMA to octopuses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30991-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[2].&lt;/a&gt; Ecstasy is known to make people extraverted, sociable, happy and longing for physical touch and the researchers wondered whether the drug would have the same effect on the social behavior of species which is a) completely different to humans and b) is known to live a solitary life and not being super social (now I’m bitter the labs I worked in never had such brilliant ideas). First off, the scientists analyzed the octopus genom and found out that they also have genes that create serotonin transporters in the brain (serotonin is the neurotransmitter which gets released in excessive amounts after taking ecstasy). They proceeded by adding ecstasy in water tanks and see there — octopuses started telling all their friends they love them while listening to techno. Or almost — they started spending more time with the fellow octopuses and even touching each other and other objects not just with one but with as many as six tentacles. Also this happened: “Another octopus was doing backflips and looked like he was playing in the water, but we don't have good ways of quantifying that.&quot;. Well, if that isn’t what I see in Berlin clubs. Overall, the scientists believe that serotonin does play an important role in the social behavior of octopuses just like it does in humans. Moreover, despite the huge differences between our brains (as the octopuses don’t have a cortex or a reward circuit like we do) it seems like the social behavior is built in on the molecular level. It is incredible that a creature with a brain which developed completely different from our own reacts to a drug in the same way — and indicates that the brain pathways of social behavior may have arisen in our common ancestor (which is more than 500 million years ago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for human studies. For one, researchers have found that taking DMT induces a state which is very similar to the near death experience (NDE) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01424/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[3].&lt;/a&gt; In order to find that out they asked people who actually experienced NDE and people whom they gave DMT to fill out a standardized questionnaire trying to grasp their experience and then compared them. Turns out, that all the people who took DMT scored above the threshold for determining an NDE; meaning that DMT seems to be able to mimic content and intensity of almost dying. The shared experiences included being in an unearthly environment, feeling peace, separating from your own body and encountering some kind of a ~~mysterious God-like entity~~. Next step would be to compare the MRI scans of both groups in order to see whether the a DMT high and an NDE share a neuroscientific basis -- and then we can step by step understand the psychology and biology of dying better. These findings alone are, however, already important, as they show that an NDE happens not because God is getting to ready to welcome Her child but because of our neurons in our brains firing in a specific way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, FDA (the US Food and Drug Administration) has recently approved a trial where psilocybin (the main ingredient in magic mushrooms) is gonna be used to treat depression &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/compass-pathways-receives-fda-approval-for-psilocybin-therapy-clinical-trial-for-treatment-resistant-depression-691452071.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the recent psychedelic Renaissance (I wrote about it here — &lt;a href=&quot;http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/6/10/lsd-shrooms-mdma-or-how-i-went-to-a-psychedelic-research-conference-in-amsterdam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;click!&lt;/a&gt;) it is known that psilocybin, LSD and ayahuasca have an immense potential to treat mental diseases (again, briefly described &lt;a href=&quot;http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/6/10/lsd-shrooms-mdma-or-how-i-went-to-a-psychedelic-research-conference-in-amsterdam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or if you want more hit me up for a research paper I wrote for the uni on this topic), so that it’s only logical that FDA gives a green light for a phase two trial. 216 patients with treatment-resistant depression will participate in the study where they will receive doses of the drug coupled with therapy sessions. If the trial is successful it can mean a marketing authorization in two to three years which is a huge revolution in depression treatment: psychedelics act fast, the effect lasts long and the side effects are virtually non-existent (if done in a controlled medical setting of course).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, blindness has received a kick in the private areas as well: researchers have successfully reversed congenital blindness in mice by manipulating cells in their retina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=30111842&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;. To do that, they used gene therapy and transformed supportive cells called Müller glia (which normally just care about retina being stable) into photoreceptors, the light-sensitive cells that actually allow us to see. Photoreceptors themselves cannot regenerate, whereas Müller cells have been shown to divide in response to injury and regenerate into photoreceptors and other retinal cells (this was shown in zebrafish, but still). With some gene therapy magic the scientists first forced the Müller cells to divide and then injected mice’ eyes with chemicals forcing the freshly divided cells to become something completely different. The newly created photoreceptors did not differ in structure from the normal ones; moreover, they functioned just as well! They were communicating with other photoreceptors and successfully transmitting the light signals to the brain. Now the scientists are running behavioral studies in order to test the performance of mice who regained their vision in tasks that require eyesight (big if true). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year three quarters of a million people take their own lives, and suicide is the leading cause of death in adolescents. Non-lethal self-harm is also prolific, leading annually to around 300,000 UK hospital visits, with even more going unreported. Knowing who is at most risk can inform support and prevention efforts. The higher rates of self-harm in LGBT and minority groups are well-established, and now a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjc.12179&quot;&gt;review article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;British Journal of Clinical Psychology&lt;/i&gt; identifies other groups, including goths, emos and metalheads, who may also be at increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34778&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British team, led by Mairead Anne Hughes at the University of Liverpool, searched both quantitative and qualitative papers on suicide and self-harm to find those that measured affiliation to a subculture – defined as marking oneself out through particular clothes, makeup, body art and musical preferences. They identified ten relevant papers, all but one involving people under 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quantitative research, a number of studies categorised participants based purely on their musical preferences (for example, based on subscriptions to &lt;i&gt;Metal Edge&lt;/i&gt; magazine). These studies showed small associations between being a heavy metal fan and greater suicidal ideation and risk. However, in the one study that accounted for potential confounders, like having a negligent father and substance use, the link disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at alternative subculture membership more generally, the team found two studies suggesting that moderate or stronger identification with a subculture is associated with a three times higher risk of self-harm and six times higher risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One explanation could simply be that people who self harm are more likely to gravitate to these subcultures. Consistent with this interpretation, the studies found associations between subculture membership and various pre-existing adversities, including bullying, difficult family relationships, and emotional and behavioural difficulties. On the other hand, several studies found that controlling for these pre-existing adversities did not eliminate the sub-culture/self-harm association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even stronger evidence comes from a longitudinal study of around 4,000 young people that found as participants became more affiliated with the subculture, their odds of self-harm increased, even after adjusting for factors like previous depression, victimisation, and history of self-harm. So this makes it unlikely that the sub-culture association with self-harm could be due entirely to selection effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves two other major explanations. One is that self-harm is the consequence of the unasked for social consequences of being an emo, goth, or metaller – such as stigma, hate crime, and victimisation. The other is that subculture membership, by its very nature, encourages self-harm by modelling these behaviours in lyrics and through the example set by leading figures.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two qualitative papers explored this latter possibility, based on analysis of internet forum comments and on interviews with emo adolescents. Their conclusions support the idea that self-harm and suicide are accepted and normalised in these subcultures, including praising of acts of self harm. But Hughes and her colleagues wondered if the data could have been interpreted differently, and they noted that online chat forums have a “performative quality” that doesn’t always give the best sense of what is really going on in people’s lives. Also, it’s worth noting that a fascination with suicide and self-harm can also be found in mainstream culture, such as in the recent Netflix hit &lt;i&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who grew up in alternative subcultures I can see the reasons for concern about contagion and modelling. I remember the breathless reporting around Manic Street Preachers’ guitarist Richey Edward’s cutting, and the preoccupation with the destruction of the body found in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_(1993_film)&quot;&gt;industrial music.&lt;/a&gt; But what resonates with me even more is when Hughes and her colleagues note how alternative culture uses morbid imagery and content in a self-aware, playful and even deflationary way. For instance, they may be dark, but the songs on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Infirmary&quot;&gt;From Here to Infirmary&lt;/a&gt; by punk/emo band Alkaline Trio, are as wry as the title. Talking about ugly or dangerous thoughts can put them into perspective, and to laugh at it can banish it. As we’ve reported before, there is evidence that having heavy metal in your life &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/04/the-scaremongers-were-wrong-metalheads-from-the-80s-are-thriving/&quot;&gt;can actually be a protective factor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their current research review, Hughes and her team conclude that “there is currently not adequate evidence to draw conclusions that these alternative subcultures themselves are in any way harmful.” But being a member is associated with elevated risks, some of which accrue over time, which is enough of a reason to give it our attention. This could be through addressing stigmatisation; providing education for people who work with youth from these groups about warning signs and routes for accessing support; and providing psychology services that appeal to people who may be anti-establishment in temperament, but who could do with help in processing what they need to sort through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjc.12179&quot;&gt;This corrosion: A systematic review of the association between alternative subcultures and the risk of self‐harm and suicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Shortly before his death, he helped prepare this obituary—his last chance to help correct the perverse incentives that too often influence the conduct and reporting of scientific research.&lt;br /&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barney rejected grand biological theories that offered neat, simple-but-wrong explanations of psychopathology. Ever aware of the complexity of the human brain, he was an early rejecter of blind optimism that any simple imbalance of monoamine transmitters could account for the wide variety of mental disorders. More recently, he deplored the ubiquitous hype that suggested that genetics or neuroimaging or big data mining could provide simple answers to deeply complex questions. He predicted—presciently—that these powerful new tools would have great difficulty in producing solid, replicable findings that could be translated to clinical practice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Conveyor belt psychiatry or game changer? iTBS v rTMS are equivalent for MDD... but no active comparator.

 &lt;p&gt;The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) hosted 70 local high school students and their teachers for Career Day, which took place on Saturday, September 15, 2018. Students and teachers enjoyed tours of MPFI facilities, a luncheon with scientists, and an interactive question and answer session. The 2018 panelists were Dr. Lesly Colgan, Dr. Michael Yetman, and Kate Maximov. The discussion was facilitated by Dr. Madineh Sarvestani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Career Day” is an annual event that gives high school students the opportunity to meet and interact with Max Planck scientists. Panelists traditionally include scientists who are in different stages of their training, from post-baccalaureate students to postdoctoral fellows. 2018’s Career Panel discussion explored many topics, including what inspired the scientists to choose a career in science, overcoming the challenges of being a woman in science, and what educational and research experiences got the researchers to the place that they are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback from both teachers and students was overwhelmingly positive. “It was an amazing experience I won’t forget as I move on in life. Hopefully, I’ll be back someday,” said student Doris Yang from Jupiter High School.  Her teacher Shari Rogers added, “Thank you for your amazing community outreach!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To participate in career day, teachers had to submit an application explaining how their students would benefit from the experience. Once selected, each school could choose ten students to attend. The schools and teachers selected for 2018 included: Steven Weber and Tamica Williams, Village Academy; Mary Paramore, Marie Dupuy and Dr. Robert Grassemi, Inlet Groove High School; Shari Rodgers, Jupiter High School; Melinda Ogden, Atlantic Community High School; Marilyn Budensiek, Hobe Sound Christian Academy; Renee Szeliga, Benjamin School; Mira Dohnd, the Conservatory School of North Palm Beach; and Ofelia Barletta Chacon, Palm Beach Gardens High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s Career Day was held as a satellite event of the international Max Planck Society’s “Max Planck Day,” which is recognized throughout Germany in 2018 as a way to mark jubilee celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Max Planck’s Nobel prize for physics, the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Max Planck Society, and Max Planck’s 160th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h4&gt;And end dumb arguments about metaphors&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*jKAc1FH4dDJUW3dWLLbFJg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;A room full of computers, and their brains.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Your brain is a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple metaphor causes raging arguments, intellectual duels, and the throwing of insults. On the one side, those aghast at the idea that the richness, imagination, and ineffability of the human mind could possibly arise from &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer&quot;&gt;something as prosaic&lt;/a&gt; as a machine pumping out a string of 0s and 1s. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/opinion/sunday/face-it-your-brain-is-a-computer.html&quot;&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt;, those aghast at the aghast, at how anyone could deny the human brain is the most wonderful information processor in the universe, and that computers can do anything they put their mind too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguments over the “brain as computer” metaphor are idiotic. Because it’s not a metaphor: it’s a theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The wrong metaphor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to have an argument about the computer metaphor, you first have to define “computer”. Let’s get the easy bit out of the way: what a computer is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computer is not the box on your desk, the tablet on your lap, or the phone in your hand right now. Assemblages of electronics with microchips, RAM, and caches: these are a particular hardware realisation of a computer. If you think the computer metaphor is about a hunk of plastic and sand, and go “aha! The brain is not like a hunk of plastic and sand”, then, well done, you’re right. But not in a useful way. It is self-evident, for example, that the brain does not have a separate chunk of grey matter that acts as a hard drive for long term storage of memories when someone turns off your power (because if someone turns off your power, you’re dead). &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer&quot;&gt;Some rejectors&lt;/a&gt; of the computer metaphor have made this error, confusing the box on their desk with a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other staunch rejectors argue the computer metaphor is just another in a long line of metaphors describing the brain using the brightest new technology of the time. They reel off a litany of metaphors used to describe the brain over the past few centuries: hydraulics, telegraphs, telephone switchboards — and now computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is dumb. The computer-brain comparison &lt;strong&gt;is not a metaphor for technology&lt;/strong&gt;. The comparison is about the formal definition of a computer. Alan Turing formally defined a computer in 1936. John Von Neumann laid out the architecture for modern electronic computer hardware in 1945. General purpose hardware computers did not exist until the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historians can (and do) argue all day about what was the first official electronic computer. But they all agree that, whatever it was, it was not built before 1936. Indeed Turing’s work was about humans: about capturing our capacity to solve problems, to compute, using a logical sequence of steps (like, say, adding up two numbers) in some formal maths. Computers were defined before the technology we now call a “computer” even existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Did someone say “Babbage”? The Difference Engine was a remarkable calculator, but a calculator nonetheless; the Analytical Engine was never built; both were mechanical. Still the mere existence of the plans for the Analytical Engine helped define the idea of a machine for computing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly galling is that the metaphor is the wrong way round: the electronic computer is a brain. Von Neumann based some of his ideas for the architecture of the electronic computer on a model of the brain advanced by McCulloch and Pitts. They pointed out that neurons either send their electrical “spike”, or they don’t. So you can think of a neuron as encoding a 1 (meaning “true”) by sending a spike, or a 0 (meaning “false”) when it doesn’t. From this assumption it follows that groups of neurons sending 0s and 1s to each other can make all the formal statements of logic. Which is rather useful for computing stuff. Von Neumann knew McCulloch well, and read their paper; he then used the ideas of encoding 0s and 1s in elements of a circuit, and of how to combine these elements to do logic, in his architecture for a computer. Computer hardware has some foundations in brain science, not the other way round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And, just to be clear, this also does not mean that the brain is a computer. Von Neumann was using a simple analogy for how neurons could be interpreted. But this interpretation completely ignores many basic things about neurons. Like neurons having a constant output for example: McCulloch and Pitts’ model just assumed either a 1 or a 0, and nothing else, during a particular computation; but neurons send spikes all the time. Indeed von Neumann noted some of the ways his computer was not like a brain in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/michaeldgodfrey/vonneumann/vnedvac.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;amp;d=1&quot;&gt;original EDVAC report&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right computer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when we say “the brain is a computer”, what do we mean? What is a computer in this metaphor? A machine for executing an algorithm: a (universal) Turing Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Pedants corner: this is not the only definition of a computer. But it is the definition that gives an intuitive understanding of how to define such a thing, and obviously fits with the pile of plastic and sand we call a “computer”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key ingredients are simple. In this definition, we require only the following. Input, in the form of symbols. Somewhere to write more symbols (Turing imagined an infinite length of paper tape. You could use strawberry liquorice laces at a pinch). A set of instructions — an algorithm — for turning the input symbols into the desired output symbols, by writing as many intermediate symbols as you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm is at the heart of it: a set of steps, that each define a single action. That are discrete: do A then B then C. You can have as many steps as you like. You can have all the loops back and forth between the steps that you like, as in the toddler algorithm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) run into wall;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) rub head;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) repeat from (1);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can have as many branching options of steps as you like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) if HUNGRY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1b) buy burrito;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) else if THIRSTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2b) buy smoothie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) else&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3b) “please leave the shop, you’re disturbing the customers”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the steps are always discrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For the completists, the Church-Turing thesis guarantees that such a machine with an infinite capacity to write symbols will complete any algorithm with a stopping condition in finite time. Assuming you wrote the algorithm correctly in the first place. Which you didn’t).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “brain as computer” hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the crux. The brain does not have discrete steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is a system of continuous dynamics. Inside a neuron is a constant diffusion of calcium, potassium, sodium, and chlorine (and innumerable proteins causing changes in its receptors and structure). The resultant small flickers of the voltage across a neuron’s membrane are continual, ongoing. When this flickering voltage reaches a tipping point a neuron will fire a spike. The spike will cause flickers of voltage in the target neurons it reaches. Circuits of neurons endlessly, continuously send spikes to each other. All these things are continuous, not discrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the sending of spikes is not discrete. We may argue that a single spike is a discrete thing, a “1” as envisaged by McCulloch and Pitts. But they are not sent in discrete steps; they are generated in continuous time. So neurons communicate in continuous time, not in discrete steps. And how neurons communicate with each other is precisely what we’re arguing about when we talk about brains “computing” or not. For neurons sending spikes to each other is how you walk, see, and smell; think, plan, and do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we’ve just defined a computer as something that executes an algorithm with discrete steps. Ergo, the brain is not a computer, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so fast. Yes, there are trivial ways in which the brain is not a universal Turing machine. The brain does not have unbounded memory. Nor does it have unbounded time in which to carry out any computation. But then, neither does a hardware electronic computer. It may feel like it takes an infinite amount of time to run the algorithm for Windows Update, but it is not, technically speaking, infinite. It will end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But saying “the brain is a computer” is an hypothesis. It is asking the question: can the sending of spikes between neurons (and all the things affecting the sending of spikes) approximate an algorithm? Or are the dynamics themselves the goal of the brain, and so can’t be described as an algorithm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which answer we give has ramifications for how we could understand the brain. If the brain is approximating algorithms, operating as if it were a computer, then we can use all the machinery of our knowledge of algorithms to study it. But if it is not approximating algorithms, then we need a completely different formal approach to understanding the brain, one not based on computing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So which is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, the brain runs algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to test if a set of neurons in the brain are approximating an algorithm. Either we can propose an algorithm that fits with the way an animal behaves, and then see if the activity of neurons approximates that algorithm. Or, we can measure the activity of neurons during a behaviour, and then see what algorithm this activity approximates. We have examples of both. Let’s take an example where we’ve derived an algorithm from behaviour first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know a lot about how animals — including us — behave when deciding between two equally dull options. Indeed there is a panoply of experimental tasks where we ask the subject to make a choice between two options based on the evidence available to them. For example, we often show primates (including us) a set of randomly moving dots, within which are embedded a few dots all moving in the same direction — either left, or right. And we ask the primate to decide which direction (left or right) those few coherent dots are moving in. So the primate stares at the screen for a while, watches the dots moving, and eventually makes a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking many of these decisions creates specific patterns of reaction times and errors. For example, the number of errors made has a lawful dependence on the proportion of dots that were moving in the same direction — the fewer the dots, the more errors are made in judging their direction. These patterns of times and errors can be reproduced by a simple model in which the evidence that the dots are moving in each direction (left or right) is added up by two counters that compete: evidence for one direction is also used as evidence against the other direction. And these two competing counters turns out to be formally the same as a decision theory algorithm (the sequential probability ratio test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we’ve arrived at an algorithm derived from behaviour: what about the brain’s activity during this behaviour? When we look in the brains of monkeys making these decisions, we see neural activity that increases and decreases over time, some activity representing the correct option, which tends to increase; and some activity representing the incorrect option, which tends to decrease. Just like two competing counters of evidence for two options. And Mike Shadlen’s lab&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4365451/&quot;&gt; have even shown&lt;/a&gt; that each jump in activity reflects the amount of evidence available, exactly like the sequential probability ratio test. Here then we see neural activity that closely approximates an algorithm we arrived at from observing behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(We can even extend the decision algorithm to more than two options, in which case we have the catchily named “multiple sequential probability ratio test”. And this more complex algorithm seems to fit with neural activity in the basal ganglia [read&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; for way more than you wanted to know about this]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have examples of where we started with the neural activity, and worked out what algorithm they seem to represent. These include a (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebrainprize.org/flx/prize_winners/previous_prize_winners/prize_winners_2017/&quot;&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt;) prize-winning triumph of computational neuroscience: the reward prediction error theory of dopamine. The data came first. In a series of papers, Wolfram Schultz had shown how dopamine neurons fired in response to rewards. A few features were particularly intriguing. Dopamine neurons burst excitedly when unexpected rewards were received. They then “learnt” to instead burst in response to something (like a light flash) that predicted a reward was imminent, and no longer burst in response to the reward itself. And once this link between light flash and reward was learnt, the dopamine neurons stopped firing when the reward was predicted but not received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these data, two teams (one with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8774460&quot;&gt;Read Montague and Peter Dayan&lt;/a&gt;, the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243646413_A_Model_of_How_the_Basal_Ganglia_Generate_and_Use_Neural_Signals_that_Predict_Reinforcement&quot;&gt;Jim Houk and Andy Barto&lt;/a&gt;) independently proposed that dopamine neurons are encoding the reward prediction error used in the algorithms of reinforcement learning theory. These algorithms are equipped with a range of options about what to do in the future, and choose an option based on the predicted value of taking each of them. Once an option is chosen, an error is computed between what was predicted and what turned out to be the actual outcome of choosing that option. This error is then used to update the predicted value of the chosen option: if the outcome was as expected, then no error occurred, and nothing needs changing; if the outcome was better than expected — a positive error — the value of the option increases; if the outcome was worse than expected — a negative error — the value of the option decreases. So this “prediction error” creates a way of turning feedback from the world into changes in behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The match between the firing of dopamine neurons and this “prediction” error was irresistible. According to Schultz’s data, dopamine neurons signal all three types of error: the absence of error when a reward is predicted, a positive error when a reward is unexpected, and a negative error when expected reward fails to materialise. A seemingly clear match between the discrete step of an algorithm and the activity of some neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Well, not quite. Reinforcement learning theory itself was inspired by decades of research on how animals’ behaviour changes as they learn from reward, and then elaborated into how to best train a computer to learn. So in truth we had behaviour -&amp;gt; computational algorithms -&amp;gt; developed far beyond behavioural observations -&amp;gt; then neural activity found that matches steps in these algorithms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI smelters among you may be wondering: what about success of deep neural networks for doing brain-like computation? Like training neural networks to classify images, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/333452a0&quot;&gt;finding units&lt;/a&gt; that have properties like neurons in visual cortex? Well, AI-style neural networks are discrete time algorithms at heart. And deep neural networks throw another issue into the mix as they have discrete layers, each feeding their output into the next one along. The brain does not have discrete layers. So the success of AI-style neural networks still leaves open the question of whether these operations can be mapped to the continuous dynamics of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another, outre, option here is that while the underlying biology of the brain works in continuous time, the effective operations of the brain are divided into discrete steps. One way this might work is through oscillations in neural activity. Brains are beset by oscillations in their activity, alternating between a short period of activity, and a short period of inactivity. If we were feeling generous, and perhaps had a little bit too much of the old vino, we could interpret each short period of activity as dividing continuous time into discrete windows. So each period of activity is one “step”. There is evidence, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(18)30630-5&quot;&gt;of attention oscillating in this way&lt;/a&gt;, our ability to mentally engage periodically switching on and off. But oscillations of brain activity are rarely sustained over long periods, and are never nice clean runs of on then off, and on then off. And these oscillation are slow: many things the brain “computes” happen on much faster time-scales. Still, this idea that actually the brain does have discrete steps deserves holding in mind. And then not in mind. Then in mind again. Then not in mind. You can see where I’m going with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, the brains does not run algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that seems like a lot of evidence that the brain does indeed run algorithms. And this conclusion is baked into a lot of neuroscience. People routinely write that the brain “computes”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/david-marr-neurosciences-einstein-6e99ba2c616d&quot;&gt;David Marr’s&lt;/a&gt; highly influential ideas for how to go about understanding the brain divide the problem into finding out the algorithm and then finding the hardware, the bit of brain, that runs the algorithm. There are some who wonder how the brain could do anything if it is not running algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a simple answer: we already know lots of things brains do that aren’t algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take running, walking, or the crawling of a baby. Or of a snail. These are all rhythmic movements, the repeated contractions and relaxations of groups of muscles. While Usain Bolt’s muscles may contract and relax faster than yours, the same patterns of neural activity are driving these contractions in you both. These patterns are repeated bursts then silence from a group of connected neurons, each burst signalling the contraction of a particular set of muscles. The repeated patterns of activity are generated within the circuit of neurons, thanks to the way the neurons are wired together. These circuits self-generate dynamics to controls repeated movements: they are not implementing any algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such central pattern generators are found in the brain whenever we find something rhythmic going on in a body (almost: the heart has its own pattern generator). Chewing, for example. Swimming. Flying. Breathing is quite important I hear. All created by circuits of neurons that continuously generate their own activity. No hint of an algorithm, unless “breath in, then breath out” counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singular movements tell us a similar story. An arm reaching for a pint glass or a stick of celery isn’t doing anything rhythmic. But we don’t need to recourse to algorithms to understand where the neural activity is coming from. A set of brief changes in the activity of neurons in the arm part of motor cortex, which talk to neurons in the spine, who contract muscles. What algorithm here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual retort at this point would be: aha! But they’re all movements — surely the richness of memory, of planning, of thought, surely these need something computational, not just “dynamics”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some solutions involving dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solution for memory. We’ve known how memory could be created by pure “dynamics” for decades: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/wired-for-memory-how-your-brain-remembers-by-completing-patterns-ad2c6d7bff89&quot;&gt;a simple memory can be stored and recalled&lt;/a&gt; simply by a circuit of neurons that fall into a particular pattern of activity given a particular input. Such networks can turn a partial input into a full memory, like how the smell of burnt toast can evoke a rich memory of a slightly disappointing childhood tea-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solution for doing things with probabilities. Our brains often make use of the probability of something happening, rather than the certainty of it happening. Rewards tend to be uncertain: you may get a promotion if you prove your dedication to the company by signing all reports in your own blood; or you may not. Recent work has shown how a network of neurons that are wired a bit like cortex, and continuously send spikes to each other, can represent probabilities. And, in so doing, can use those probabilities to solve problems. There’s one network that &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003311&quot;&gt;solves Sudoku puzzles &lt;/a&gt;(yep, its output needs translating into symbols to do this: but those symbols are ours, not the network’s — it has no idea it’s solving a Sudoku puzzle.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solution for doing practically anything with an input. With a name that should really be a manga, Liquid State Machines are a general solution to the problem of “doing stuff with continuous dynamics”. They are a group of randomly-wired together model neurons that continuously send spikes to each other. The important bit is that the network is a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with the latter making their target neurons less likely to fire a spike. Why this is important is that the resulting network is almost guaranteed to have chaotic dynamics. And chaotic dynamics give us a very rich playground in which to do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They mean that the transient change in the network’s activity given some input is very different from that given a slightly different input. This big difference is a non-linear response to inputs, yet can easily be read out by a downstream set of neurons. So, in principle, you can achieve any operation on the input you like. The question is: how would a bit of brain end up (through the unholy trinity of evolution, development, and learning) with exactly the right kind of wiring, and the right kind of read out, to get the desired operation on those inputs? Good question, that needs answering. And people are working on answering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no answer, yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many who think the brain is not a computer. Esteemed physicist Roger Penrose dedicated two long books to the idea. Yet he somehow leapt from the premise that “the brain is not a computer” to the existence of quantum consciousness without considering there may be something in between. Like what the brain actually does: produces continuous dynamics that may or may not approximate an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain is a computer” is not a metaphor. It is an hypothesis, one that can be defined rigorously enough that we can actually test it. And people can. And are. For hypothesising that a bit of brain runs a certain algorithm makes predictions: predictions about how the activity in that bit of brain will change when the world changes (in ways that are relevant to that algorithm); or predictions about how previously unsuspected bits of brain should be involved in a task if the brain is to compute the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such predictions have been made for the hypothesis that dopamine neuron firing is a “prediction error”. For example, we can make predictions about what the inputs to the dopamine neurons should be. Recall that the dopamine neurons stop firing when there is a negative prediction error, the error when a reward was expected but not delivered, and they stop firing exactly when the expected reward was supposed to turn up. To do this, the dopamine neurons would need to receive an inhibitory signal that stops their activity at exactly the time the reward was expected. A decade of work has shown that the lateral habenula seems to provide exactly this timed inhibitory signal to the dopamine neurons. And this is just one of the many possible predictions that could be tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one study will clinch the argument a bit of brain runs algorithm X. Science doesn’t work like that. Support for an hypothesis comes from multiple strands of work, each perhaps weakly supporting the idea, but when weaved together form a giant basket of righteous science (I never claimed to be good at metaphors either). So the answer is not here yet, and any answer will come slowly but inexorably, like a psychopathic slug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I think the brain is a computer? No. I am fully prepared to be totally wrong about that. I have quoted, taught, and even published papers arguing that brains implement algorithms. As I have just shown in all of the above, I can agree with two opposing ideas at the same time. Scientists must often live with such ambiguity: as arguments get polarised into yes/no questions, so it becomes clear that neither position is true. The human mind is fantastic at dealing with ambiguity. Come to think of it, does that mean it’s not a computer, after all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after consensual and satisfactory sex, most people report feeling positive, content and psychologically close to their partner. But for some, it has the opposite effect, leaving them tearful and irritable for anything from a few minutes to a few hours. Commonly known as the “post-sex blues”, psychologists call it “post-coital dysphoria” (PCD) and until recently they had only studied it in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in 2015, Robert D Schweitzer at the Queensland University of Technology led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26797056&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; of 230 Australian female students, in which 46 per cent reported experiencing PCD at some point in their lives, and about 2 per cent said they experienced it regularly.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now masters student Joel Maczkowiack and Schweitzer have published – in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy&lt;/i&gt; – the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2018.1488326&quot;&gt;first ever study&lt;/a&gt; to show that some men suffer from PCD, too.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34733&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted an anonymous online survey of 1,208 men aged 18 to 81, from 78 different countries. Most were in a relationship that had lasted for at least a year.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-one per cent of these men reported having experienced PCD at some point in their lifetime, and for 20 per cent, it had happened in the four weeks preceding the study. Just over 4 per cent reported experiencing PCD regularly. The descriptions of how PCD feels included, “I don’t want to be touched and I want to be left alone”; “I feel unsatisfied, annoyed and very fidgety”; and being “emotionless and empty”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey also assessed current symptoms of depression and anxiety and past sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Current psychological distress was associated with PCD, but it was not a major predictor (which was also the case in the study of women). Childhood sexual abuse was also linked to PCD but, again, as for women, it was a minor factor in explaining the results. For the men, sexual dysfunction was implicated in some cases, but it certainly wasn’t a major risk factor. Exactly what accounts for PCD in many people is not clear. It has been suggested that, for some, at least, the symptoms might be caused by the fall in levels of endorphins and certain hormones that peaked during orgasm.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first study to show that men do experience PCD, this work challenges common assumptions about sex always being pleasurable for men, the researchers say. “Males who experience PCD, and their partners, may find it comforting to know that they are not alone in their experience and that negative postcoital experiences may simply reflect normal variation in [the] human sexual response,” Maczkowiack and Schweitzer write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I have argued that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;the neural coding metaphor is highly misleading&lt;/a&gt; (see also similar &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiii-the-interactivist-model-of-cognition/&quot;&gt;arguments by Mark Bickhard&lt;/a&gt; in cognitive science). The coding metaphor is very popular in neuroscience, but there is another domain of science where it is also very popular: genetics. Is there a genetic code? Many scientists have criticized the idea of a genetic code (and of a genetic program). A detailed criticism can be found in Denis Noble’s book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Music-Life-Biology-Beyond-Genes/dp/0199228361&quot;&gt;The music of life&lt;/a&gt;” (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21135048&quot;&gt;Noble 2011&lt;/a&gt; for a short review).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the arguments I have made in my essay on neural coding readily apply to the “genetic code”. Let us start with the technical use of the metaphor. The genome is a sequence of DNA base triplets called “codons” (ACG, TGA, etc). Each codon specifies a particular amino-acid, and proteins are made of amino-acids. So there is a correspondence between DNA and amino-acids. This seems an appropriate use of the term “code”. But even it in this limited sense, it should be used with caution. The fact that a base triplet encodes an amino-acid is conditional on this triplet being effectively translated into an amino-acid (note that there are two stages, transcription into RNA, then translation into a protein). But in fact only a small fraction of a genome is actually translated, about 10% (depending on species); the rest is called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_DNA&quot;&gt;non-coding DNA&lt;/a&gt;”. So the same triplets can result in the production of an amino-acid, or they can influence the translation-transcription system in various ways, for example by interacting with various molecules involved in the production of RNA and proteins, thereby regulating transcription and translation (and this is just one example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when DNA does encode amino-acids, it does not follow that a gene encodes a protein. What might be said is that a gene encodes the primary structure of proteins, that is, the sequence of amino-acids; but it does not specify by itself the shape that the protein will take (which determines its chemical properties), the various modifications that occur after translation, the position that the protein will take in the cellular system. All of those crucial properties depend on the interaction of the product of transcription with the cellular system. In fact, even the primary structure of proteins is not fully determined by the gene, because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing&quot;&gt;splicing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the genome is not just a book, as suggested by the coding metaphor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/288/5475/2304.long&quot;&gt;some have called the genome the “book of life”&lt;/a&gt;); it is a chemically active substance that interacts with its chemical environment, a part of a larger cellular system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the genetic code metaphor, genes encode phenotypes, traits of the organism. For example, the gene for blue eyes. A concept that often appears in the media is the idea of genes responsible for diseases. One hope behind the human genome project was that by scrutinizing the human genome, we might be able to identify the genes responsible for every disease (at least for every genetic disease). Some diseases are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder#Single_gene_disorder&quot;&gt;monogenic&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., due to a single gene defect, but the most common diseases are polygenic, i.e., are due to a combination of genetic factors (and generally environmental factors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even the idea of monogenic traits is misleading. There is no single gene that encodes a given trait. What has been demonstrated in some cases is that mutations in a single gene can impact a given trait. But this does not mean that the gene is responsible by itself for that trait (surprisingly, this fallacy is quite common in the scientific literature, as pointed out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01677063.2018.1468443&quot;&gt;Yoshihara &amp;amp; Yoshihara 2018&lt;/a&gt;). A gene by itself does nothing. It needs to be embedded into a system, namely a cell, in order to produce any phenotype. Consequently, the expressed phenotype depends on the system in which the gene is embedded, in particular the rest of the genome. There cannot be a gene for blue eyes if there are no eyes. So no gene can encode the color of eyes; this encoding is at best contextual (in the same way as “neural codes” are always contextual, as discussed in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;neural coding essay&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the concept of a “genetic code” can only be correct in a trivial sense: that the genome, as a whole, specifies the organism. This clearly limits the usefulness of the concept, however. Unfortunately, even this trivial claim is also incorrect. An obvious objection is that the genome specifies the organism only in conjunction with the environment. The deeper objection is that the immediate environment of the genome is the cell itself. No entity smaller than the cell can live or reproduce. The genome is not a viable system, and as such it cannot produce an organism, nor can it reproduce. An interesting experiment is the following: the nucleus (and thus the DNA) from an animal cell is transferred to the egg of an animal of another species (where the nucleus has been removed) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/72/3/510/2666963&quot;&gt;Sun et al., 2005&lt;/a&gt;). The “genetic code” theory would predict that the egg would develop into an animal of the donor species. What actually happens (this was done in related fish species) is that the egg develops into some kind of hybrid, with the development process closer to that of the recipient species. Thus, even in the most trivial sense, the genome does not encode the organism. Finally, since no entity smaller than the cell can reproduce, it follows that the genome is not the unique basis of heritability – the entire cell is (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29148257&quot;&gt;Fields &amp;amp; Levin, 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the genome does not encode much except for amino-acids (for about 10% of it). It should be conceptualized as a component that interacts with the cellular system, not as a “book” that would be read by some cellular machinery.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papt.12184&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice &lt;/i&gt;argues that the relationship a person has with their eating disorder is shaped by that person’s understanding of what meaningful relationships should look like – and, in turn, this can have important consequences for the severity of their disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, Emma Forsén Mantilla and her team from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden wanted to better understand eating disorders through “attachment theory”. This is the idea that relationships with primary caregivers become scripts that we lean on to tell us how relationships “work”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34774&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parent perceived as being protecting will lead a child to feel trust, according to this theory, and to expect a protection-trust dynamic in future relationships. A more troubled caregiver-child relationship, in contrast, leads to a different form of attachment, and downstream consequences – including believing that it’s normal that people who care about you attack you. In addition, attachment tells us how it’s appropriate to treat ourselves – such as by attacking or judging ourselves. Once these dynamics have formed, we gravitate towards them especially when we’re distressed (and being prevented from following these learned dynamics can trigger yet more upset).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating disorders are more common in people with less secure attachment styles, and on the surface there are certain parallels in how people experience eating disorders and the attachment dynamics described above – for instance, it is when distressed that people with eating disorders are most likely to seek consolation in comforting, but ultimately counterproductive, eating behaviours, and people with eating disorders can become even more agitated when they are prevented from performing these behaviours.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a deeper connection between attachment theory and the experience of eating disorders in what some researchers and service users have previously labelled the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/11/28/recovering-patients-describe-their-battles-with-an-anorexia-voice/&quot;&gt;anorexic voice&lt;/a&gt;” – when symptoms are maintained through harsh and forceful judgments about oneself and instructions to the self that are attributed to the anorexia condition. Despite its negative, attacking nature, the voice is often still considered an ally rather than an enemy, again resembling certain insecurely attached relationships. So it seems a plausible to see eating disorders in these terms, especially as attachment patterns can be established in how people relate to non-humans – pets and even God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantilla’s team tried to establish a coherent pathway between eating disorder clients’ attachment styles and their symptoms. They ran a correlational study involving 148 women with eating disorders aged 16-25 recruited from outpatient units in Sweden. The researchers measured eating disorder behaviours with questions like “over the past 28 days, on how many days have you made yourself sick (vomit) as a means of controlling your shape or weight?”and found, consistent with previous findings, that these behaviours were more pronounced in people with a less secure attachment style (assessed with questions like “I feel confident about relating to others.”). &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantilla also asked participants to complete a survey normally used to look at specific attachment dynamics with a significant other, but in this case rephrased to focus on the eating disorder – e.g. “It punishes and tortures me, takes revenge” – as well as whether they turned these patterns inward.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers predicted, less securely attached individuals in general tended to see their eating disorders as more controlling, and themselves as less autonomous. These individuals were also more likely to treat themselves in a blaming way, and this self-blaming and the sense of a controlling quality to their eating disorder entirely explained the association between overall attachment and their eating disorder symptoms and behaviours.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a plausible story can be made from the data that insecure attachment produces a tendency to internalise blame and an expectation of a controlling relationship that then takes shape in an eating disorder, producing eating disordered symptoms accordingly. In a correlational design, of course, this is not proof but has a sense of plausibility to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In helping people to work past eating disorders, psychologists using narrative therapy already characterise the disorder as an external entity in a relationship. This research may be useful in honing in on the aspects of this relationship most strongly associated with actual eating disorder behaviours – the controlling nature of the disorder and how it may prop up and reinforce self-blame. It also suggests the likely obstacles faced by these clients in forming other relationships, which may prevent them developing emotional support and regulation that in itself can prevent relapse. And the results shed light on why people can be appear to be so wholly in the grasp of an eating disorder – because losing it can almost feel like losing someone who “gets” you. Anorexia and similar conditions can be like a tight embrace that goes both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papt.12184&quot;&gt;The unsafe haven: Eating disorders as attachment relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how important maths skills are in everyday life, it is vital that we develop ways to reliably identify those children with particular learning difficulties related to maths (known as “specific learning disorder in mathematics”/SLDM or dyscalculia) so that they can be provided with appropriate support. Unfortunately, maths-related learning problems are far less understood and recognised compared with similar problems related to reading and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12322&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt; highlights this issue, being the first to estimate the prevalence of SLDM/dyscalculia in primary school age children using contemporary criteria (as outlined by the American Psychiatric Association in the latest version of its diagnostic manual). The results provide much needed data on this topic, reveal some worrying facts and also useful insights for policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34762&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is based on nearly 2,500 children, aged 7 to 13, from 19 rural and urban schools in Northern Ireland. The data are averages of several years’ standardised test results of the children’s maths, reading and IQ, together with background demographic information and notes on any diagnoses of other developmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, diagnosis of SLDM/dyscalculia took a child’s IQ into account a child, such that a specific problem with maths was only diagnosed if their maths ability was low relative to their IQ – the so-called “discrepancy criterion”. The newer diagnostic criteria (in DSM 5) abandon this principle. Now a persistent, significant problem with maths counts as SLDM/dyscalculia even if it occurs alongside comparably low IQ or other learning problems (however SLDM is still discounted in the context of extremely low IQ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the new criteria, Kinga Morsanyi and her colleagues at Queen’s University Belfast, estimated the relevance of SLDM/dyscalculia in primary school children at around 6 per cent. This is substantially higher than previous estimates of 1.1 per cent prevalence based on the earlier diagnostic criteria. Morsanyi’s team said this could have “huge consequences for children’s outcomes” because it means more children ought to be able to access maths-based educational support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat worryingly, however, the data showed that only one child in the sample had actually received a formal diagnosis of SLDM/dyscalculia, in contrast with 108 children who had received a diagnosis of dyslexia. Given that prevalence rates of SLDM/dyscalculia and dyslexia are usually similar, the researchers explained that this means “we can say that a child with dyslexia was more than a hundred times more likely to receive an official diagnosis of that disorder (which is necessary to obtain specialist educational support) than a child with dyscalculia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, the revamped diagnostic criteria ought to lead to the identification of more children with SLDM/dyscalculia, thus opening up the chance for them to receive specialist support, but in practice this does not seem to be happening. At least, not yet. Moreover, from speaking to educational psychologists, Morsanyi and her team said the situation is compounded by the fact the educational psychologists said there are “no generally accepted intervention methods that could be recommended” for SLDM (a further complication is that the new diagnostic criteria state that maths problems should be persistent in spite of interventions, which promotes the unhelpful idea that extra support for children with SLDM/dyscalculia is futile – the researchers challenge this view and point to their finding of reduced prevalence of SLDM/dyscalculia with age as evidence that persistent maths problems can be addressed effectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An important first step,” to addressing these issues, they said, “would be to raise awareness of SLDM/dyscalculia among both teachers and educational psychologists as part of their work training.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of demographic background and other concurrent diagnoses, the new data suggest that children with persistent maths problems also often have problems with English and low IQ; tend to come from relatively deprived backgrounds; usually have other special educational needs; and are more likely to have “newcomer status” (meaning that English wasn’t their first language). The researchers said that additional support for maths should be given to children with SLDM/dyscalculia regardless of the source of their maths problems (be they environmental or cognitive or a mix of the two). They also noted that there were some children with SLDM/dyscalculia who also had a diagnosis of autism, but none with a concurrent diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final finding to note concerns gender differences – overall, there was no evidence that girls or boys were more likely to have dyscalculia/SLDM (or be exceptional in maths), which contrasts with the situation for dyslexia, which is about twice as common among boys. However, when the researchers matched girls and boys for IQ and English scores (which were generally higher in girls overall) and special educational needs status, there was evidence of more maths problems among girls than similar status boys – what the researchers described as “… a hidden gender difference in maths performance even among primary school children. That is, although girls do not underperform in terms of their actual scores, they underperform relative to their cognitive/learning potential”. Considering reports that many girls lose interest in maths and science at around age 11, the researchers said another policy implication of their results was that intervention programmes aimed at encouraging girls into science and maths subjects should start even earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a prepared media statement, Morsanyi wrote that “From these figures, we can estimate that about 10,000 children in Northern Ireland have sustained, serious difficulties with mathematics. Given that virtually no children in our sample received an official diagnosis of mathematics disorder, we can expect that most of these children do not receive educational support with mathematics. This can have very important adverse consequences.” She added that “…these figures in the UK in general would be much higher.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do some people go to great lengths to have the chance to spend time by themselves, while others find solitude painful and forever crave company? The most obvious answer would seem to be that it relates to differences in social aspects of personality, and specifically that extraverts will find solitude painful while introverts will enjoy their own company more than anyone else’s. However, a new paper, published as &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/sjcwg&quot;&gt;a pre-print&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;PsyArXiv&lt;/em&gt; (not yet peer-reviewed), and involving three diary studies with hundreds of undergrad volunteers, suggests the truth is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there was no evidence that introverts enjoyed solitude more than extraverts. Rather, the most important trait related to liking one’s own company was having strong “dispositional autonomy”. This is a concept from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory&quot;&gt;self-determination theory&lt;/a&gt; and the researchers, led by Thuy-vy T. Nguyen at the University of Rochester, said that people strong in this trait have alignment between their behaviour, values and interests, are “resistant to pressure from others”, and “are interested in learning more about their personal experiences and emotions”. High scorers in autonomy enjoyed solitude more than others and sought it out for its own sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34734&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the studies involved asking the participants to spend 15 minutes a day in solitude (on seven different days) and then to complete detailed questionnaires afterwards about how they’d found the experience. Introverts enjoyed solitude no more than extraverts (although there was a slight tendency for them to experience fewer negative thoughts), and it didn’t satisfy their basic psychological needs either, such as their feelings of autonomy and competence. In contrast, higher scorers in dispositional autonomy (as measured by agreement with statements like “My decisions represent my most important values and feelings” and “I am deeply curious when I react with fear and anxiety”) enjoyed solitude more than others, experienced fewer negative thoughts and it fulfilled more of their basic psychological needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings for enjoyment of solitude chime with two of the other diary studies that looked into people’s motivations for finding time alone. This showed mixed findings for introverts: one study, but not the other, found that introverts were more likely to engage in “reactive solitude” (that is, being by themselves as a way of escaping being with others). Meanwhile, higher dispositional autonomy was correlated with more “constructive solitude”, which is seeking out solitude for its own sake. Introversion was not correlated with seeking constructive solitude in either study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While taking caution, given that this research has not yet been peer-reviewed, and remembering that further investigations could offer a different perspective, the current results suggest we need to rethink our assumptions about introverts and extraverts and how they experience being alone. If an introverted person doesn’t feel they have chosen to be alone, and they have sought out solitude for relatively negative reasons (as a form of escape), then it would be wrong to assume that just because they are introverted that they will enjoy their situation. Savouring solitude seems to be more associated with being the kind of person who feels free and in control of their life and who finds pleasure in reflecting on their inner experiences – and among both introverts and extraverts there will be those who do and do not fit this description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at the relevance of their participants’ “attachment styles” –  ways of relating to others that are thought to be shaped by the treatment received from caregivers early in life. Among the findings here was that people with an avoidant attachment style (who tend to see others as untrustworthy) sought out more constructive solitude – that is, they wanted to be alone and valued that time more than with others  – but when they actually experienced solitude, they didn’t necessarily enjoy it and had more negative thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Thuy-vy Nguyen and her colleagues said they had shed new light on how people experience solitude, and especially that how it feels to be alone “might be a function of how individuals self-regulate experiences and behaviours, more generally, rather than merely based on introversion or avoidance of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting Jean-Paul Sartre (“&lt;em&gt;If you’re lonely when you’re alone, you’re in bad company&lt;/em&gt;“), the researchers added that “… to the extent that individuals are compelled by guilt, anxiety, or avoidance rather than approaching experiences with self-reflection and interest, they will find solitude an unpleasant experience, and derive little enjoyment from time spent alone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the physical jostle, thrust and tug of sport there is a parallel contest involving words. Although this trash talking between players before, during and after games is well known, it is surprisingly unstudied by psychologists. Yet these exchanges play a major role, arguably swinging the outcome of games. Consider an infamous example: the 2006 football world cup final in which Italy’s Marco Materazzi insulted the sister or mother (depending on whose account you believe) of France’s star player Zinadine Zidane, who in turn responded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/7xmj4y/zinedine-zidane-and-the-most-important-headbutt-in-the-world&quot;&gt;head butting&lt;/a&gt; Materazzi. Zidane was then sent off, with Italy going on to win the game on penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is trash talking more prevalent in some sports than others? What does trash talk tend to be about? A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-018-9317-3&quot;&gt;exploratory paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Human Nature&lt;/em&gt; is among the first systematic investigations of trash talking in sport, and certainly the first to examine the phenomenon through an evolutionary lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34730&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Kniffin and Dylan Palacio at Cornell University surveyed 291 undergrad student athletes (including 141 men) who represented their university at the top level in various sports including gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, squash, swimming, diving, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students’ task was to indicate how frequently they had ever trash talked against opponents on a number of topics, including those directly relevant to the sport, such as  playing ability, and those less directly relevant to the game, but arguably having evolutionary significance around competing for mates, such as physical appearance, sexual behaviour and slighting opponents’ partners. The students also made the same judgments about how much trash talking they had witnessed by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the students’ reports, trash talking was relatively frequent, and mostly focused on sporting issues, such as physical ability and athleticism. However, they said there was also significant trash talking off-topic, especially about opponents’ physical appearance, relationships and sexual behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together with the fact that trash talking was reported to be notably more common among male players than female players, and also among competitors in contact sports, the researchers said their findings are consistent with the idea that trash talking is a form of verbal aggression – perhaps originating as a form of intra-sexual competition between males – that has survived as a competitive convention because it brings advantages to the trash talker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extra detail is that there was no evidence that trash talking was more frequent among combat sport competitors who wear masks, suggesting anonymity makes no difference in this context (unlike, say, online).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kniffin and Palacio stressed that this was an exploratory study on a little studied topic, and they also caveated their main finding of a gender difference, noting that trash talking may vary with masculinity as a trait, or even with physical size or formidability, rather than maleness per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair hope their study will provide a foundation for future research, which could address this question of masculinity, as well as others, such as whether trash talking varies with age and superstar status; how it affects the recipient; and whether some people are more resilient to trash talking than others. On this last point, the researchers speculated that “in light of research suggesting that sports participation, by men at least, is a form of courtship display, it might be that the same people who are most likely to trash talk are also most likely to be responsive to it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/09/its-peer-review-week/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Peer Review Week 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is all about diversity. To look at the changing scholarly landscape, we interviewed science publishing historian, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/staff/aileenfyfe.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Aileen Fyfe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, who draws on her experience working in the archives of the Royal Society to explain how diversifying the pool of experts involved in the peer review process can further advance the scientific record.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How diverse is the peer review process at the moment?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Until more people start publishing their data on both their community of authors and reviewers it’s difficult to tell. There’s certainly concerns about the geopolitical balance, whether the global north is doing much more of the refereeing, whereas the global south is doing a lot of authoring, and not so much refereeing. So that’s a large scale problem. There are certainly suspicions about women’s involvements, whether women are underrepresented as reviewers and editorial board members. The stats that we have so far do suggest that that’s true. But we still don’t know very much about other forms of diversity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One of the points that I’d like to make about diversity in peer review is that there is always going to be some limit on how diverse peer review can be, because peer review by its nature doesn’t let just anyone do it. So we select as peer reviewers people who have got some form of shared expertise, some certain standards of training and education, and some form of research credentials, which nowadays generally means having published a couple of papers. So, there’s already a limit on exactly how diverse the pool can be, there are going to be some people who are not going to be invited to do this. And for peer review to work we wouldn’t want to lose that. But the interesting question becomes, within those limits, within the pool of people who have the appropriate level of education and professional research training are there any other reasons why diversity should be restricted. Nowadays we would probably say no to that, we wouldn’t think that religion or gender, geographical location or socioeconomic status should have anything to do with it. But those things have all often historically been tied up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Over the years we’ve extended our understanding of who can be involved in peer review, but we don’t want to lose the sense of recognising what good science looks like. But, on the other other hand, there is room for a lot within that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What happens when the peer review process isn’t diverse? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;An immediate worry is that the process wouldn’t be fair if, for instance, decisions about global science were routinely being made by a handful of elite researchers in a handful of elite institutions. And we know that everyone carries implicit biases against people who are not like them—which is a particular worry in those fields of research that currently use single blind review systems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But, you’ve also got the worry that with any group of similar minded people who share an understanding of what good science looks like, you’ve got a tendency to commit towards intellectual conservatism. Will they recognise the innovation, the speculative approach that turns out to be really fruitful? Because if you’re looking for stuff that is familiar and solid and rigorous and good, maybe you’ll miss something that’s exciting and novel, so there’s also that kind of aspect of diversity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This intellectual diversity is slightly different from the social economic, gender, class, ethnicity that we talk about today. And nowadays we try to separate those things, and reckon hopefully we can have intellectual diversity and also have diversity of types of people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We want to try and ensure that the people doing the editorial and reviewing work, aren’t being too prone to groupthink if you will, that they won’t be dismissing new approaches, new ideas, because they don’t look like the ones that they are familiar with, so there’s a worry that the scientific content could suffer if all the people doing the reviewing all comes from the same institution or from the same sub-field of a discipline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What can we do to support diversity in the peer review process and scientific discourse in general?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One of the things that does seem to work is talking about it! When I look at the change in statistics for the Royal Society’s journals over the last 30 years, it’s quite clear that something has happened…, in terms of who is writing for the Royal Society and reviewing for the Royal Society, that has changed a lot since the 1980s early 1990s and I think it’s changed much more recently than that, and you have to ask why. And the only reason that I can see is that that organisation has started talking a lot about diversity, it has started gathering the statistics, and it’s started wondering what it can do better. And it looks as if that works. In terms of the number of editors, this is still rather male only, but the editorial boards, the publicly visible aspect, is getting better; and diversity among reviewers themselves is also getting better, it’s now similar to the number of authors in terms of gender. The proportion of women who are reviewers is similar to the proportion of women who are authors, which seems like a reasonable place to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;So, talking about it, asking questions, getting people to publish their stats.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I think that that raising awareness thing, which is becoming more common, does seem to be focusing people’s minds, even if it’s just focusing editors’ minds… on who are they going to choose. And that’s the first step towards making some sort of progress, so they don’t automatically go to whatever the equivalent of an old boys club is right now…. And this could be your institutional network, the people you know and went to graduate school with, it could be that kind of group, and ideally you want something more diverse than that. And if you got the editors thinking about that, then that’s got to be a good first step.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;About Aileen Fyfe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all differ in how much empathic brain activity we experience in response to witnessing somebody else in pain. For instance, hospital physicians, who are regularly exposed to other people’s suffering, tend to show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207019793&quot;&gt;a dampened response&lt;/a&gt; – perhaps a pragmatic necessity to cope in the job, and might along the way explain the blasé gallows humour seen in the profession. If these differences are found within a job, perhaps they also occur within a lifestyle choice, such as one that involves playing with and consenting to painful activities, such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism, typically abbreviated to BDSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393217300337?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia&lt;/em&gt;, Siyang Luo at Sun Yat-Sen University and Xiao Zhang at Jinan University explored this issue by first running a preliminary online study on a Chinese BDSM web forum, finding that across genders and BDSM roles, female submissives showed the clearest differences from controls in terms of their having a diminished response to other people’s pain and lower scores on aspects of an empathy questionnaire. (Female doms didn’t show a reliably different response to pain, and male BDSM practitioners barely differed from controls.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34727&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Luo and Zhang invited 32 of these female submissive practitioners together with 32 female controls, into their lab, where they measured their electrical brain activity with EEG (electroencephalography) while they viewed images of faces with either neutral or painful expressions. The self-identified submissive participants found painful expressions less unpleasant and intense than controls, and when the images were framed in a BDSM context, they also found them more enjoyable and arousing, loosely replicating what was suggested by the online experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EEG data showed that an early negative spike in brain activity in the frontal lobes (called N1) was larger for the controls when they saw painful versus neutral stimuli, and more so when the participant found the images particularly unpleasant. But for the submissives, the N1 was similar in both cases. Past research has implicated N1 in registering threatening information, such as that denoted in a fearful face, so this could suggest that the submissives were seeing less threat, understandable given submissive practices that willingly incorporate pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a positive spike in brain activity, also in the frontal lobes (called P2), which is usually associated both with pain and emotion processing, was flattened in submissive participants when they viewed generic pain – again suggesting less empathic response. However, when seeing BDSM-related images, their P2 was actually larger than controls, and this correlated with their subjective arousal ratings, suggesting that the brain response was capturing their interest in pain rather than distress. A third brainwave signal, also associated with emotion processing (the “LPP” in the parietal lobe), also showed an attenuation in the submissive group, corroborating the case for a weakening of empathic response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luo and Zhang also measured their participants’ day-to-day empathy, in terms of how they related to other people. Again, the submissive group had significantly lower empathy scores than controls, centred on lower reported ability to take different perspectives – e.g. “I find it difficult to see things from the other guy’s point of view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is limited to one subgroup of people who practice BDSM, and doesn’t implicate the wider field. The fact that the effects were initially discovered for women, not men, may reflect the fact that men tend to be less empathic to begin with. And the online study’s identification of submissive practitioners, rather than dominant ones, as having lower than normal empathy and an atypical response to pain, could reflect that this is the subset of people who willingly expose themselves to pain experience, which could be densensitising, or because this group is made up of individuals started out less sensitised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last issue is a point to emphasise – because we don’t know whether the kind of person drawn to submissive practices is different from the norm, the study doesn’t show that practicing BDSM causes any changes in empathy. But that the differences could be produced by the practice is certainly conceptually possible, both from the general principles of brain plasticity and from more specific insights from pain science. Working in a pain management service over this summer has left me in no doubt that our relationship with pain is shaped by psychological factors, and can change over time. More research will be needed to tell if this is the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If submissive practices were causing empathic changes, would this matter? On the one hand, our neural empathic responses don’t dictate our moral capacities – we don’t assume that emergency ward doctors are less caring than stockbrokers, even if they are less sensitised to someone suffering from an injury. Some even argue that being tethered to reactive empathy is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/06/against-empathy-paul-bloom-the-empathy-instinct-peter-bazalgette-review&quot;&gt;a moral state we would do well to forego&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, as we covered here at the Digest recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/05/super-altruists-whove-donated-a-kidney-to-a-stranger-show-heightened-empathic-brain-activity-when-witnessing-strangers-in-pain/%2523more-34660&quot;&gt;there is evidence&lt;/a&gt; linking neural empathic responses to even very concrete altruistic decisions like donating a kidney to a stranger. Also, if the lower trait empathy scores among the BDSM practitioners were the product of their sexual practices, this would arguably be worth reflecting on, as it could have potential consequences for the quality of their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393217300337?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;Empathy in female submissive BDSM practitioners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educational neuromyths include the idea that we learn more effectively when taught via our preferred “learning style”, such as auditory or visual or kinesthetic (hear more about this in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/29/episode-13-how-to-study-and-learn-more-effectively/&quot;&gt;recent podcast&lt;/a&gt;); the claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/&quot;&gt;we use only 10 per cent of our brains&lt;/a&gt;; and the idea &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/brain-myths/201206/why-the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-will-probably-never-die&quot;&gt;we can be categorised into left-brain and right-brain learners&lt;/a&gt;. Belief in such myths is rife among teachers around the world, according to several surveys published over the last ten years. But does this matter? Are the myths actually harmful to teaching? The researchers who conducted the surveys believe so. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475349/&quot;&gt;reporting their survey results in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Sanne Dekker and her colleagues concluded that “This [belief in neuromyths] is troublesome, as these teachers in particular may implement wrong brain-based ideas in educational practice”. (Full disclosure: I’ve made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/12/10-ways-brain-myths-harming-us/&quot;&gt;similar arguments myself&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now this view has been challenged by a team at the University of Melbourne, led by Jared Horvath, who have pointed out that this is merely an assumption: “Put simply,” they write in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01666/full?utm_source=F-NTF&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLX&amp;amp;utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, “there is no evidence to suggest neuromyths have any impact whatsoever on teacher efficacy or practice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horvath’s team tested the assumption that belief in neuromyths harms teaching by comparing belief in the neuromyths among 50 award-winning teachers from the UK, USA and Australia with the belief in these same myths shown by hundreds of trainee and non-award-winning teachers (as recorded in the earlier surveys) – the logic being that if belief in neuromyths has an adverse effect on teaching then presumably the award-winning teachers will show significantly lower rates of endorsement of the myths than their less celebrated counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34717&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Melbourne researchers used the same neuromyths questionnaire as used in the earlier surveys, which comprises 32 statements about the brain, 15 of which are myths. Participants must indicate whether each one is correct, incorrect, or say if they don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 13 of the 15 neuromyths, including learning styles, the 10 per cent myth and left-brain/right-brain learners, belief was just as high among the award-winning teachers as among the trainees and non-award-winning teachers. “This suggests there is not a clear or obvious relationship between neuromyth acceptance rates and teacher effectiveness,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two exceptions were the idea that “there are critical periods in childhood after which certain things can no longer be learned” and that “children must acquire their native language before a second language is learned”, which the award-winning teachers showed less endorsement of compared with the other teachers. The researchers said they were apprehensive to read too much into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horvath’s team also found the neuromyth questionnaire itself to be wanting because it lacked any internal reliability (answers to the different items appeared entirely unrelated suggesting the questionnaire does not tap one or more coherent factors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, they interpreted their findings as suggesting that the idea that neuromyths harm teaching may itself be a neuromyth. “As has been frequently noted, there is a real risk of neuroscience being misapplied in educational contexts,” the researchers said. “However, in combating this occurrence, it is imperative researchers do not simply create a different mythology equally devoid of evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new findings appear to argue against the idea that belief in neuromyths is harmful to teaching, but it’s important to recognise – and Horvath and his colleagues admit this – that the new survey does not represent a direct test of this question, and there could be many explanations for the results. For instance, and as the researchers speculate, it’s quite possible that the judges allocating teaching awards themselves believe in neuromyths, such as learning styles, and perhaps they even deliberately rewarded teachers who had incorporated such myths into their teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If further research supports the idea that neuromyths have a negligible effect on teaching, this would not be the first time that concerns about misunderstanding neuroscience have turned out to be somewhat overhyped. For instance, for several years it was widely believed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/03/31/the-power-of-blobs-on-the-brain/&quot;&gt;images of the brain have a seductive allure&lt;/a&gt;, but it later turned out that this effect was &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/03/04/are-we-now-blase-about-brain-scans/&quot;&gt;difficult to replicate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a day exploring a new city and it’s time to return to your hotel, do you tend to rely on landmarks and routes that you’ve learned, or do you consult a “mental map” that you’ve created of the area, to try to devise a short-cut back? If you’re a man, you’re more likely to try the latter – whereas women tend to use routes they know, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-018-0811-y?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&amp;amp;utm_source=toc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=toc_13421_46_6&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Memory and Cognition&lt;/i&gt; by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34713&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Alexander Boone, Xinyi Gong and Mary Hegarty are keen not to be seen as promoting the idea that men are better navigators, a mental map approach is generally regarded as being superior, as it permits novel shortcuts (when they are possible, of course). And in this new virtual reality study, men were not only significantly more likely than women to take short cuts, but they were, on average, more efficient at finding their way to target locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran two experiments on groups of UC Santa Barbara students. In the first, 68 men and women were guided along a set route through a virtual maze. The maze measured 55 by 55 metres, and appeared to have concrete walls. Twelve objects (including a chair, a duck, a wooden well and a stove) were placed at various points along the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning this route, the participants were re-positioned at different locations along it and asked to navigate to another point; for example they were placed near the wooden well and asked to navigate to the stove. Each participant completed 24 navigation trials. In half, it was possible to take a novel shortcut. In six, the shortest novel route and the learned path were the same length, and in a further six, the learned route was in fact the shortest path to the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two raters looked at the routes that the participants took in all the trials and coded each as ‘taking a shortcut’, ‘taking the learned route’, ‘reversing the learned route’, or ‘wandering’. To assess navigation efficiency, times and distances travelled to the goals were all computed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second experiment, involving a new batch of 72 students, was largely a replication of the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both experiments, men showed a greater preference for taking shortcuts than women, who were more likely to follow learned routes and to wander. And on average, the men were significantly faster, and covered less ground, in reaching the target objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have either found no gender differences on navigation challenges, or found that the male participants did better. This study goes a little further, in that it investigates the kinds of strategies that men and women tend to choose themselves. (Interestingly, the strategies that the participants actually used didn’t match up well with the kinds of strategies they reported generally taking.) Still, the findings do tally with those suggesting that men tend to be superior navigators in situations in which: a). It’s possible to create a mental map, and b). that map can be useful (in an environment where shortcuts aren’t possible, it’s not likely to help). The researchers do stress, however, that some women in their study were just as efficient as the best male performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If men are more likely to use mental maps, which permit shortcuts, and women are more likely to use known routes and to wander, why might this be? It has been suggested by psychologists that while using landmarks and known routes won’t always be as efficient, this is likely to be a safer option for women (who, it’s argued, are more vulnerable than men), both in terms of avoiding getting lost and in reducing the risk of encountering something dangerous. (If taking a shortcut turns out to require tiptoeing around a bear’s den, the risk to life surely outweighs the potential gain in cutting a few minutes from the journey home…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, even in the cases when men and women used the same strategy to navigate, the men were faster at getting to the targets. Why might men be faster at following or reversing a known route? All the participants did get some training in navigating around a VR maze. But the men reported spending more time playing video games than the women. Perhaps that extra gaming practise explains it. In a real-world environment, would men still have the advantage? Only future research can tell.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) announces that Dr. Jason Christie, MPFI Research Group Leader, has been awarded a grant in the amount of $2,082,074 over five-years to support ongoing investigation of neural circuits in the cerebellum that instruct and guide motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum, an anatomically unique region of the brain, plays a central role in fine motor control and motor learning. When functioning normally, the cerebellum is essential in learning and performing skilled movements, but its dysfunction has been linked to movement disorders such as ataxia (progressive loss of fine motor skills) and dystonia (uncontrollable muscle contractions). These types of disorders make daily movements increasingly difficult as neurons in the cerebellum degenerate. The goal of this study is to identify how neurons in the cerebellum interact with one another, providing fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying motor learning. Specifically, Dr. Christie and his team will examine the role of a prominent class of inhibitory interneurons that may determine how and when learning occurs. This project will provide new discoveries into the computational principles of the cerebellum and aid in the development of new therapies aimed at ameliorating diseases affecting motor control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motor learning occurs when mistakes are made while performing movements. Specialized cells in the cerebellum, called Purkinje cells, receive powerful instructive signals that guide our behavior and improve subsequent movements. What has remained largely unknown, is how these instructive signals are modulated to produce a spectrum of learning outcomes. Through his research, Dr. Christie has identified the importance of a key type of neuron, Molecular Layer Interneurons (MLIs), that may be essential in modulating error signals and driving adaptability of motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing the latest and most advanced imaging and genetic techniques, MPFI scientists in Dr. Christie’s lab will study the role of MLIs in motor learning from the cellular level, to circuit dynamics and ultimately, how their activation affects behavior. With the support of this crucial funding, Dr. Christie’s research will provide a better understanding of how neural circuits in the cerebellum ensure accurate movement, turning the motor errors we make into reliable, adaptable and meaningful learning; laying the foundational science that will lead to tomorrow’s cures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christie joined the Max Planck Florida Institute in July 2010 as Research Group Leader in Synaptic Signaling and Computation. Prior to this appointment, Dr. Christie conducted research at the Vollum Institute at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon, where he completed his doctoral and post-doctoral work. He has joint faculty appointments with  Florida Atlantic University.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/09/Peer-Review-Gender_blog-image-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer Review Week is a global event celebrating the essential role that peer review plays in how we evaluate and communicate most scholarly research. Our aim is to spark discussion and collaboration between researchers and publishers who want to improve scholarly communication. For that, there’s no better jumping off point than this year’s topic: diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How diverse is it? The scholarly landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the demand for STEM degrees is on the rise around the world, we still see a relatively small percentage of published papers out of countries in Africa and Latin America. Even more troubling, are the increasingly common stories of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/07/why-science-is-breeding-ground-for-sexism?CMP=share_btn_link&quot;&gt;unsafe &lt;/a&gt;working conditions, lack of resources, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/math-women/506417/&quot;&gt;perceptual biases&lt;/a&gt; keeping women out of many higher academic fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/21718/elife-21718-v1.pdf&quot;&gt;eLife&lt;/a&gt; found the percentage of female authors, reviewers, and editors in STEM publishing falls far below 50% and predicts these percentages, 37%, 28% and 26% respectively, would not achieve parity with male counterparts until 2042 if currents trends of growth continue. In some fields, the difference in representation is even more staggering. For example, a review of 435 Mathematical journals published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161357&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found the median number of editorships held by women to be only 7.6%. Fifty-one journals had no women on their editorial boards at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the eLife study, both women and men show an inclination to appoint reviewers of the same gender, limiting possibilities for women on a journal with an editorial board comprised of mostly men and perpetuating the imbalance of representation. Another study in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192481&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found similar results, as well as evidence of preference for other shared background characteristics such as country or institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a journal’s peer review process is only as diverse as the network of editors who oversee it, we must diversify our editorial boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of publishers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers, as stewards for scientific research, have a responsibility to raise all voices of the community. To do that, we must offer the tools and opportunities for researchers from all backgrounds to participate in the scholarly discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we can do is to actively seek an even mix of expertise, affiliation, nationality, and gender to represent the editorial board and journal staff. We also need to start stepping outside our comfort zones, ask ourselves whether our tried and true models really work for everyone or if they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2018/02/02/581849526/leaky-pipelines-plug-the-holes-or-change-the-system&quot;&gt;hidden barriers&lt;/a&gt; for certain groups. Some great advice for publishers and organizations is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/11/16/diversity-scholarly-communications/&quot;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/12/12/tackling-diversity-scholarly-communications-part-2/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting the conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer review and how to make it better is the focus of many organizations that just last month penned an &lt;a href=&quot;http://asapbio.org/letter&quot;&gt;Open Letter&lt;/a&gt; to the community regarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/08/transparency-credit-and-peer-review/&quot;&gt;transparent peer review&lt;/a&gt;. Through posted and signed reviews, we’re taking steps to further our understanding of peer review and to open up opportunities for critical conversations about peer review best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later this week, we’ll be posting an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/staff/aileenfyfe.html&quot;&gt;Aileen Fyfe&lt;/a&gt;, science publishing historian, who will talk about the importance of unique voices to advance scientific literature.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2018/09/10/peer-review-week-2018-diversity/&quot;&gt;EveryONE blog&lt;/a&gt; also has an additional perspective, as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/gender-imbalance&quot;&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of papers on gender inequality in peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we invite you to raise your own voice and share your experiences with the hashtags #PeerReviewWeek18 and #PeerRevDiversityInclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/BMCWordle-620x342-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Gastroenterology: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-018-0831-x&quot;&gt;Preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea using probiotics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics can have a number of side effects, the most common being gastro-intestinal such as diarrhea. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is caused by antibiotics disrupting the ecology of the intestinal microbiota, altering the diversity and numbers of bacteria in the gut. This can lead to long-lasting effects on the balance of the intestinal microbiota and consequently on the patient’s susceptibility to infection and other diseases. In an article published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Kort &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;present a practical guide to the use of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10492&quot; style=&quot;width: 970px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10492 size-full&quot; height=&quot;566&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/antibiotics-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that probiotics were associated with lower incidence of AAD overall. In addition, there are a number of factors affecting the efficacy of probiotics, such as strain composition, probiotic product formulation, and specific patient differences (e.g. – genetic factors). The researchers concluded that there is sufficient evidence to make a recommendation for the use of specific probiotic products for the prevention of AAD. In particular, Kort &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; recommend &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&lt;/em&gt; GG as the most effective probiotic to prevent AAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1843-3&quot;&gt;Men’s suicidality in Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10414 alignright&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Reasons-for-dying-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;287&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender has been emphasized as crucial for understanding suicidal behavior. Previous research has concluded that men who adhere to traditional masculinity seem to have increased health risks compared to those who do not. Further research has shown that some circumstances make men more vulnerable to suicidal behavior, such as single marital status, unemployment and retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a published article in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Knizek and Hjelmeland sought to investigate what men who have engaged in a suicidal act perceived as crucial for their decision to harm themselves or attempt to take their life&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted interviews with men who were admitted to hospital after a suicidal act. It was concluded that the main reason or trigger for the suicidal act were complex problems in intimate relationships, with some men saying pain and ennui were reasons. The most striking finding was how unique and different each story was, which makes it important to consider that standardized efforts of suicide prevention may not be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-018-0181-0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life history traits in a capital breeding pine caterpillar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host plants (or the plants an organism relies on) are thought to play important roles in the evolution of various traits for herbivorous insects. Liu &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; sought to investigate the influence of host plant species and pine needle age on larval performances, adult mating behavior and fitness consequences in a capital breeding caterpillar, &lt;em&gt;Dendrolimus punctatus&lt;/em&gt; Walker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the pine species and needle age significantly affected larval performance, such as developmental duration, survivorship, and body weight. Male body weight was significantly influenced by pine species and needle age; however interestingly, female body weight was only significantly influenced by pine species, not by needle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the importance of larval host plants on larval performance and adult reproductive fitness in this pine caterpillar. The previous-year needles of one particular pine (masson pine &lt;em&gt;P. massoniana&lt;/em&gt;) were concluded to be the best host for this pine caterpillar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Anesthesiology: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12871-018-0574-9&quot;&gt;Palliative care in intensive care units&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9183 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/medical-563427_960_720-pixabay-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Distressing symptoms are common for most intensive care unit (ICU) patients and their families. Previous research has suggested that palliative care assessment should start as early as possible in ICU patients at a high risk of dying, to minimize unnecessary suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review article published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Anesthesiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discusses palliative care in ICUs and provides anesthesiologists and critical care physicians practical advice on the application of palliative care in ICUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICU doctors should be familiar with and competent in all aspects of palliative care through dedicated training&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, ICU doctors may not have the knowledge to effectively carry out palliative care. Therefore, Cortegiani &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; conclude that ICU doctors should be familiar with and competent in all aspects of palliative care through dedicated training. Such training would provide critically ill patients and their families access to care that would meet their needs and improve patients quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-018-0255-y&quot;&gt;Emotion regulation and its relation to symptoms of anxiety and depression in children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10493&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10493&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/child_sad-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation of emotions is considered to be important in children’s adaptive development. Previous studies have found that children who repeatedly fail to regulate their emotions in accordance to context are at greater risk of developing internalizing symptoms associated with anxiety and depression. Loevaas &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. sought to investigate the associations between anxious and depressive symptoms and difficulties in emotion regulation in Norwegian school children in a published article in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a lack of positive strategies to regulate emotions were associated with anxious and depressive symptoms. Therefore, emotional regulation is considered to be a potentially important target in the prevention and identification of children at risk of anxiety and/or depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was found that there was no difference between the maternal and paternal reports regarding the association between emotion regulation in children and anxiety symptoms; though there were differences for depressive symptoms. The study highlighted that research involving children should include both parents if possible, to prevent the chance of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcenergy.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: A new journal in the BMC Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Energy&lt;/em&gt; covers theory, development and applications in the interdisciplinary field of energy and fuel research from across the physical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new journal in the BMC Series opened for submissions in August. The journal, &lt;em&gt;BMC Energy&lt;/em&gt;, adds to BMC Series’ expansion into the engineering and energy research fields, joining the already launched &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcchemeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; journals. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Energy&lt;/em&gt; covers theory, development and applications in the interdisciplinary field of energy and fuel &lt;/span&gt;research from across the physical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10494&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10494&quot; height=&quot;217&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/solar-panel-e1536575475684-300x217.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;The journal will cover the following sections: Solar thermal energy; Bioenergy; Low carbon energy sources; Carbon capture, storage and applications; Energy storage; Energy systems, processes, planning and policy. The journal is open access and peer reviewed, and does not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The old pseudoscience methods involved listening to tapes and records. From a 1958 article by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.modernmechanix.com/learn-while-you-sleep/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Learn While You Sleep (Mechanix Illustrated, Nov 1958)&quot;&gt;Lester David&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Max Sherover, president of the Linguaphone Institute of New York ... coined the word “&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4781.1950.tb04902.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Sherover M (1950). Dormiphonics—A New Language Learning Technique. The Modern Language Journal 34: 444-446.&quot;&gt;dormiphonics&lt;/a&gt;,” defining it as a “new scientific method that makes quick relaxed learning possible, awake or asleep.” Dormiphonics, declares Mr. Sherover, works by “repeated concentrated impact of selected material on the conscious and subconscious mind.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An “experiment” was conducted at the Tulare County Prison, where 100 convicts “&lt;a href=&quot;https://sleeplearning.com/info/learn-while-you-sleep/&quot;&gt;volunteered&lt;/a&gt; to act as guinea pigs” (considered completely unethical by today's standards). During sleep, they were subjected to low-volume recordings that exhorted them to be better human beings: “Love shall rule your life. You shall love God, your family and others.  You shall do unto others as you want others to do unto you. . .” The low voice also warned them away from the evils of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LCqcBZYGb7s/W5XUvtCjHJI/AAAAAAAAMnQ/-q1ZOQlbghYrKy13xer504kBgS0nbTIZwCLcBGAs/s1600/Learn%2Bwhile%2Byou%2Bsleep%2Balbum%2B%2528basic%2Bconditioner%2529.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1024&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1011&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LCqcBZYGb7s/W5XUvtCjHJI/AAAAAAAAMnQ/-q1ZOQlbghYrKy13xer504kBgS0nbTIZwCLcBGAs/s400/Learn%2Bwhile%2Byou%2Bsleep%2Balbum%2B%2528basic%2Bconditioner%2529.jpg&quot; width=&quot;393&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/LEARN-WHILE-YOU-SLEEP-KNIGHT-EDUCATION-INC-PLP-06-60s-RED-SELF-HELP-VINYL/273437929222&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;comes in groovy red vinyl&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knight Education Recordings (1960s)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;a commercially available product of the era&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even earlier, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://centerhistorypsychology.wordpress.com/2017/02/23/the-psycho-phone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Psycho-Phone&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://centerhistorypsychology.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/ben2.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Psychology: Health, Happiness, Success&quot;&gt;Salinger, 1927&lt;/a&gt;) played wax cylinders with different self-help messages, e.g., “Prosperity” and “Life Extension” on a phonograph while the unwitting customer slept.

These &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transcranial direct current stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (tDCS) kits are available online, with a primary goal of enhancing cognitive performance. Using state-of-the-art professionally manufactured devices, scientists have published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22transcranial+direct+current+stimulation%22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thousands&lt;/a&gt; of peer-reviewed papers, with mixed results as to the efficacy of different tDCS protocols.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A newer method is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00279/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transcranial alternating current stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (tACS), which delivers stimulation within precise frequency bands with the aim of synchronizing oscillations within that band (e.g., ~10 Hz for alpha, ~1-4 Hz for delta, etc.). The goal is to modulate ongoing oscillatory brain rhythms to affect behavior.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, the importance of sleep for the consolidation of previously learned material has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dormivigilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/05sleep-memory-1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Sleep-dependent memory consolidation&quot;&gt;well-documented&lt;/a&gt;.   Conceptually, this is quite different from the discredited “subliminal  sleep learning” from days of yore. New research aims to improve retention of information learned during the day by delivering precisely timed and calibrated tACS during slow wave sleep (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/33/7314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ketz et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iztyMnlpaAo/W5YJD8otfhI/AAAAAAAAMno/B_njLqHMMWsRlqrHXpEVAzflmGT6jNwYACLcBGAs/s1600/tDCS%2Band%2BtACS%2Bexperimental%2Bprotocol.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;984&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1305&quot; height=&quot;301&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iztyMnlpaAo/W5YJD8otfhI/AAAAAAAAMno/B_njLqHMMWsRlqrHXpEVAzflmGT6jNwYACLcBGAs/s400/tDCS%2Band%2BtACS%2Bexperimental%2Bprotocol.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 1 (modified from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/33/7314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ketz et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(A)&lt;/b&gt; Target detection task. &lt;b&gt;(B)&lt;/b&gt; Memory was tested on two image types: &lt;u&gt;Repeated&lt;/u&gt; (identical to Original) and &lt;u&gt;Generalized&lt;/u&gt; (same as Original but from different viewpoint). &lt;b&gt;(C)&lt;/b&gt; tDCS montage used during training (left), and tACS montage used to augment slow waves during sleep (right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the day, participants were trained on a difficult military task that required them to detect hidden targets (explosive devices, snipers, suicide bombers) that were concealed or disguised (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387543/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clark et al, 2012&lt;/a&gt;). As in their earlier study, tDCS or sham stimulation was delivered during the training phase (over right frontal or right parietal cortices). Previous findings indicated that significant improvements in learning and performance were observed after 30 min tDCS (anodal 2.0 mA) vs. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ejn.12307&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Challenges of proper placebo control for non‐invasive brain stimulation in clinical and experimental applications&quot;&gt;sham&lt;/a&gt;” (0.1 mA). However, this tDCS finding did not replicate in the current study (see &lt;b&gt;Fig, 3A&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;left &lt;/i&gt;below). Why? The authors speculated that possible differences in current generation between their previous iontophoresis system (2.0 mA) and the present use of StarStim (1.0 mA) could explain the failure to replicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After training, tACS was delivered during sleep. The authors' cool closed-loop approach recorded the dominant slow wave (SW) frequency, and then delivered stimulation to match the phase and frequency of this dominant oscillation (range of 0.5 to 1.2 Hz). &lt;b&gt;Fig. 3A&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;) doesn't look terribly impressive, however. tACS did not improve performance for Repeated images, and had highly variable effects for Generalized images. Nonetheless, the two- and three-way interactions were significant, as was the pairwise comparison between active tACS vs. sham for Generalized images (all p's ≈ .015 for n=16).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xLRKowSX1kM/W5YPIsxzP8I/AAAAAAAAMn0/CB7eq9rYR3k8P0UH2xD6yDtT-Q2q2aQuQCLcBGAs/s1600/waking%2BtDCS%2Beffects%252C%2BSW%2BtACS%2Beffects.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;876&quot; data-original-width=&quot;979&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xLRKowSX1kM/W5YPIsxzP8I/AAAAAAAAMn0/CB7eq9rYR3k8P0UH2xD6yDtT-Q2q2aQuQCLcBGAs/s400/waking%2BtDCS%2Beffects%252C%2BSW%2BtACS%2Beffects.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3 (modified from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/33/7314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ketz et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;). (A)&lt;/b&gt; Waking tDCS effects (&lt;i&gt;left&lt;/i&gt;) and SW tACS effects during sleep (&lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;b&gt;(B) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;SW events broken down  per sleep stage (&lt;i&gt;left&lt;/i&gt;) and total SW events for each stimulation  condition (&lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;). Note that active stimulation had fewer total SW events compared with sham. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why was there no change in performance for Repeated images but a small improvement for Generalized images? The authors recognize this conundrum and say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...it is unclear why there was no improvement in Repeated images induced by SW tACS, as might be expected based on previous studies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they speculate that consolidation of essential ‘gist’ — rather than recognition of specific items — was impacted by tACS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Media coverage of this modest finding was predictably overblown, and originated with the Society for Neuroscience press release, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-07/sfn-obs071818.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Overnight Brain Stimulation Improves Memor&lt;span id=&quot;goog_660392221&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;goog_660392222&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Non-invasive technique enhances memory storage without disturbing sleep. &lt;/i&gt;If it enhances memory storage, then why were Repeated images unaffected? Anyway, most commenters at &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17790711&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; were pretty skeptical, which was a pleasant surprise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;However, there is some question whether tACS delivered at typical stimulation intensities can really entrain endogenous rhythms (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01045-x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lafon et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clark VP, Coffman BA, Mayer AR, Weisend MP, Lane TD, Calhoun VD, Raybourn EM, Garcia CM, Wassermann EM.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/alcohol1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain, drinking alcohol is a common practice among White British women; in 2016, just over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/drugusealcoholandsmoking/datasets/adultdrinkinghabits&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;half of this population&lt;/a&gt; had consumed alcohol in the last week. While most White British women keep their consumption within the recommended safe limits, patterns of heavy drinking associated with long and short term health and social harms have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14659890802040880?src=recsys&amp;amp;journalCode=ijsu20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; in the last 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that women &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/47/3/355/146168&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consume more alcohol in private&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. their own and others people’s homes) than in public settings (e.g. pubs and bars) and that heavy drinking can occur in couple relationships &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.13397&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;as well as non-family relationships&lt;/a&gt; (including friends, neighbours and work colleagues). Increased understanding of the meanings that alcohol has for women could help with developing appropriate and relevant interventions for heavy alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0629-6?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Women's_Health-Behavior-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_SEPT2018_Alcohol_White_British_Women&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Our work&lt;/a&gt; explored one context for women’s alcohol use: in relation to stress. It was conducted in the North East of England where White British women have some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.digital.nhs.uk/pdf/s/q/hse2016-summary.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highest levels of heavy episodic drinking in the country&lt;/a&gt;. We conducted one-to-one qualitative interviews with twenty-six women aged 24-67 years with a range of relationships statuses and from different socio-economic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the participants were in treatment for alcohol misuse, but their narratives suggested they drank at a range of levels, from irregular consumption to heavy regular consumption. We gathered data on the women’s experiences of stress, drinking practices generally and drinking practices in relation to stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_analysis&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thematic analysis&lt;/a&gt; and the application of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_care&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Feminist Ethics of Care Theory&lt;/a&gt; helped to identify ‘care practices’ as one key theme in the data. This illustrated that they lacked opportunities for receiving care amongst their caregiving and paid work responsibilities. Overall, the key finding is that alcohol was incorporated in ‘care practices’ as a way of enabling care for self and care with others in their couple relationships, when alone and in non-family relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The findings – alcohol and care practices in different relationships &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some women spent a lot of time alone at home, either because they lived alone, because they were single mothers or because their partners were frequently out. While often reflecting that they would rather be with others, these women described drinking as one way of caring for themselves when no options for human care were available. Penny, who at the time of interview had grown-up children, described a regular drinking practice alone when her children were younger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘(My husband) was out a lot at work, he was having to, you know, he was a Director of a company, . . . You didn’t have very much time for yourself and you probably, I probably did have a glass of wine when I was cooking the tea, because it might well have been that I was on my own more.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10510&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10510 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/iStock-922786904-300x201.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Drinking at home alone was not acceptable to all women and some said they did not like to drink alcohol when their children were in the house.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;© zinkevych / Getty Images / iStockq&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they always considered their responsibilities to others first, drinking regularly in a controlled way was acceptable to Penny and some other women. However, drinking at home alone was not acceptable to all women and some said they did not like to drink alcohol when their children were in the house, as this was perceived to be putting themselves above their children. More commonly, women spoke about drinking in their couple relationships and with non-family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple relationship, which can come with greater expectations of care than other relationships, dominated many of the women’s accounts. For some women in the sample, paid work and unpaid caregiving in families meant they had little time to spend with their partner. Jane, a woman with three children aged under 10 years, explained a regular drinking practice with her husband. This example is representative of other participants’ accounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘. . . it’s a drink just to drink because it’s Friday, do you na what I mean? Just sit with him and spend some adult time with him. . . . Ya na, after having three kids, I’ve learnt . . .  we have to make time for each other.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of women like Jane had little freedom to leave the house with their partners, due to child care responsibilities and limited finances, so they were restricted in what they could do to demonstrate care for each other. Drinking together and spending time together at home was one way they did this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other participants who had more flexibility or financial resources to drink outside the home described practices of drinking in public settings (sometimes alongside other activities such as a meal) in a similar way. Drinking together played a role in helping to maintain the women’s relationships but could contribute to sometimes regular and sometimes irregular heavy drinking practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data highlighted that non-family relationships can also be an important source of care for women. Drinking in these relationships offered opportunities for care, in particular emotional support, which was sometimes absent or limited in their couple and other family relationships. Nina was a single professional woman who lived alone who said she preferred not to drink alone at home. She described the value of a regular Friday night heavy drinking practice with her friends in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘If I’ve had a really, really bad week, by Thursday I’ll be . . . at the end of my tether, and I’ll know that on Friday . . . I know there’s a group of people who will just listen to me go, how crap my week has been . . . ’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10500&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10500 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/alcohol3-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Other participants described practices of drinking in public settings (sometimes alongside other activities such as a meal)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nina gained care in this practice that she did not gain anywhere else. Her account resembled some of the accounts of the mothers of dependent children who described the value of drinking practices with friends for providing care that was limited in their family and sometimes paid work roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also suggested that the women modified their drinking practices to fit in with their own and each other’s family roles and responsibilities. One participant spoke about drinking regularly and heavily at her friend’s house because her friend was a single mother and could not drink out of the house. Overall the data demonstrated the importance of sometimes heavy drinking with non-family for providing opportunities for care in their everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for intervention development? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small study which may not be able to be extrapolated to a wide population. However, inferences can be made from the findings about approaches to intervention development. The key implication of the study is that interventions need to consider that both women’s own need for care and their responsibilities to others are important in their drinking practices. Addressing this lack of care by providing alternative ways for women to care for themselves and to gain social support might be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These approaches are at odds with the current approaches which are often based on individual behaviour change and see alcohol use as separate from women’s wider everyday lives and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

 University of Bristol mysteriously lost its senior lecturer, Abderrahmane Kaidi. His institutional website was wiped out in August 2018. I obtained an internal email which lifts the mystery: Kaidi was namely found guilty of &quot;having fabricated research data&quot;, and resigned with &quot;immediate effect&quot;. Affected by research misconduct are also publications from Kaidi's postdoc period with Stephen Jackson in Cambridge.</content>

 &lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;My review of &lt;i&gt;Paywall: The Business of Scholarship&lt;/i&gt; has been published in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;. Below are the first two paragraphs. The full review can be read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06140-7&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Billed as a documentary, &lt;i&gt;Paywall&lt;/i&gt; would be more accurately described as an advocacy film. Its intention seems to be to persuade viewers that the paywalls that restrict access to journal content online are an unnecessary hangover from the print era, and now serve only to perpetuate the excessive profits that legacy publishers such as Elsevier, Wiley and Springer Nature make from the public purse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The film makes a convincing case that the paywall system creates problems — and that universal open access (OA) to scholarly articles would be better for society. But it fails to adequately explore the thorny challenges that arise with OA publishing. These include the fact that the publishers castigated by the film would continue to dominate scholarly communication in an OA world; the increasingly expensive ‘pay-to-publish’ model, which substitutes inequities in access for inequities in affording publication; and the rise of predatory publishing. And although &lt;i&gt;Paywall&lt;/i&gt; acknowledges that current reward systems have slowed the progress of OA publishing, it does not address the puzzling question of why academics have proved so reluctant to make copies of their published papers freely available in their institutional repositories ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06140-7&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an increasing number of young children transitioning socially to the gender opposite to their birth sex, and with rates of bullying and discrimination against transgender youth known to be high, researchers say it is important that we begin to understand more about how cisgender children (those whose gender identity matches their biological sex at birth) view their transgender peers. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15248372.2018.1498338&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognition and Development&lt;/em&gt; is the first to explore the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34688&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across two studies, a team led by Selin Gülgöz at the University of Washington in Seattle, presented dozens of cisgender five to ten-year-olds with vignettes about hypothetical peers who were either cisgender or transgender. For instance, in the second study, which used more comprehensive vignettes, one description the children heard was of a baby named Jack who was born with a boy’s body, but who liked playing girl games, wearing girl clothes and who told her parents she was actually a girl and wanted to be called Annie and referred to as “she” and “her”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participating children’s task was to rate how much they liked each child they heard about in the vignettes and to categorise them as either a boy or a girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children generally rated their peers positively, whether cisgender or transgender. However, on average, they rated cisgender peers more positively than transgender peers. Note, though, that the well-known preference that children show for other kids of their own gender also applied, to an extent, to transgender identities – so, for cisgender girls, for instance, their liking for transgender girls (natal boys who had transitioned socially to a female identity) was higher than their liking for cisgender boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of how they categorised the gender of their transgender peers, the participating children were inconsistent. Some categorised transgender peers by their natal sex (i.e. according to their biological sex at birth); others according to their peers’ transgender identity; while others switched between the two approaches. To the researchers’ surprise, they found that the older children – who they expected to be more accepting of transgender identities – were actually more likely to categorise transgender peers by their natal sex. The researchers speculated that this may be because of the older children’s growing sense of gender as a usually stable concept, rather than as malleable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final important finding was the association between how the cisgender children categorised their transgender peers and their patterns of liking towards those peers – specifically, those who tended to categorise transgender children by natal sex also showed less liking of them, mirroring similar findings with adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research makes a first contribution toward understanding this topic, but inevitably it has some significant limitations. Apart from the reliance on vignettes, this includes that the transgender children were all presented as being entirely gender stereotypical (i.e. behaving and having interests in line with the stereotypes associated with the gender they had transitioned to) – it remains to be seen how cisgender children might feel toward transgender peers who do not conform to the stereotypes of the gender they have transitioned to, especially considering young children’s tendency to hold peers who do not conform to gender stereotypes in low regard. Also, note these new findings are based on children from a liberal American city, whose parents were happy for them to participate in such research. One can imagine the findings being different in other cultures and contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gülgöz and her colleagues said “We look forward to future work that specifically investigates the relation between cisgender children’s attitudes toward their transgender peers and the well-being of those transgender children, as well as work investigating effective ways to reduce bias against transgender children.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/Migraine-Brain-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraine’s primary symptom is sudden and intense headache usually on one side of the head. The brains of migraineurs are different in both their structure and function. Migraineurs who experience more migraines have more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3795609/pdf/WNL205445.pdf&quot;&gt;structural abnormalities including decreases in grey matter and lesions in white matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functioning of the migraine brain is also atypical. Changes in the external and internal environments can trigger abnormal electrophysiological and vascular changes throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One neurophysiological &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2013.192&quot;&gt;explanation for migraines is cortical spreading depression&lt;/a&gt;. During cortical spreading depression, the electrical activity of neurons in a certain brain area is silenced. Once a certain threshold of depression occurs, this silencing spreads throughout the brain like a ripple in a pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression often begins in sensory associated brain areas such as those involved in vision. The origin in visual areas could explain the migraine aura, afflicting a third of migraineurs, which manifest as flickering lights or scintillating spots in the visual field preceding the onset of the headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10504 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/Migraine-300x200.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Vasodilation, the dilation of blood vessels, in the brain appears to be another cause for migraines. The trigeminal nerve which is found at the bottom of brain is important for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. Upon the onset of headache in migraines, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274576/&quot;&gt;trigeminal nerve will release a chemical called calcitonin gene-related peptide&lt;/a&gt; (CGRP). CGRP will relax the blood vessel walls causing vasodilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the treatments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding effective treatments for migraine has been a challenge. Fifteen years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11537990-000000000-00000&quot;&gt;triptans&lt;/a&gt; represented an important step toward migraine attack resolution and symptomatic treatment. Triptans are drugs which bind to and activate specific serotonin receptors called 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt; and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1D&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;Activating these receptors with triptans can have multiple effects. Triptans can impact trigeminal nerves involved in pain by decreasing the release of CGRP and substance P, a chemical known for its pain producing properties. Triptans can also modulate the activity of certain brain areas and induce vasoconstriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bph.12763&quot;&gt;botulin toxin&lt;/a&gt;, also known as BoTox®, was introduced as the first treatment for chronic migraine. BoTox® is usually thought of as a substance used for cosmetic surgery, but there is also evidence for its clinical potential. Botulin toxin may help headaches through multiple mechanisms. One mechanism describes how upon injection botulin toxin is taken up by cranial nerves in the face and travels up the trigeminal nerve into the central nervous system. Botulin toxin then reduces inflammation and inhibits the release of CGRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bph.12763&quot;&gt;botulin toxin&lt;/a&gt;, also known as BoTox®, was introduced as the first treatment for chronic migraine. BoTox® is usually thought of as a substance used for cosmetic surgery, but there is also evidence for its clinical potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next milestone in migraine treatment arrived with the approval of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5486583/pdf/11940_2017_Article_463.pdf&quot;&gt;CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy&lt;/a&gt;. Monoclonal antibody therapy involves the creation of antibodies that bind to a specific protein, in this case CGRP, or its receptor. When antibodies bind to these proteins or receptors it inactivates them. By inactivating CGRP, vasodilation caused by this molecule can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promising non-pharmacological therapeutic options are currently being assessed, but need to be validated. Noninvasive neurostimulation techniques, such as noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation, have shown potential in resolving migraine attack. Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation involves the stimulation of the vagal nerve via a device that is placed on the skin of your neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other non-pharmacological approaches, such as physical exercise or acupuncture, has demonstrated efficacy in small groups of patients and are worthy of further development through controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a continual search for the various structural and functional abnormalities in the brain which generate such incredibly painful and debilitating events. Our knowledge on pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies is increasing over time, but the challenge of present and future studies is the improvement of migraine management to avoid the evolution toward a chronic form.&lt;/p&gt;

 Journals have retracted all but 19 of the 313 tainted papers linked to three of the most notorious fraudsters in science, with only stragglers left in the literature. But editors and publishers have been less diligent when it comes to delivering optimal retraction notices for the affected articles. That’s the verdict of a new analysis … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/09/06/when-it-comes-to-retracting-papers-by-the-worlds-most-prolific-scientific-fraudsters-journals-have-room-for-improvement/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;When it comes to retracting papers by the world’s most prolific scientific fraudsters, journals have room for improvement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>
