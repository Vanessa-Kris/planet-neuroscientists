		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In an increasingly globalized and mediatized world, in which mental illness is one of society’s most discussed cultural artifacts, Colleen Patrick Goudreau’s words ring out: “If we don’t have time to be sick, then we have to make time to be healthy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the prevalence of mental health problems, it is clear why. Mental health issues are one of the leading causes of the overall disease burden globally, according to the World Health Organisation. One study reported that mental health is the primary source of disability worldwide, causing over 40 million years of disability in 20 to 29-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to previous generations, mental illness is now said to surpass the effects of the Black Death. The root causes of the unprecedented rise in people directly affected by mental illness, and the cost of this, can be considered across at least three levels of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we don’t have time to be sick, then we have to make time to be healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleen Patrick Goudreau&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first level of analysis, the root cause of mental illness is an amalgamation of heredity, biology, environmental stressors, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/01/18/coping-with-trauma-lessons-from-resilient-individuals/&quot;&gt;psychological trauma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notions of specific genes being responsible for illness have been supplanted by those of genetic complexity, where various genes operate in concert with non-genetic factors to affect mental illness. That is, health-relevant biology and mental health impact each other in a complex interplay, which is inherently social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the importance of understanding the social underpinnings of biological risk factors for mental illness, there is a relative paucity of research investigating this topic. Research that does exist, is nevertheless engrossing. For example, one study, of many, found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2006/05/15/anti-stigmatization-social-isolation-and-mental-illness/&quot;&gt;social isolation&lt;/a&gt; leads to increased risk of coronary heart disease. Since low levels of social integration are related to higher levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation related to coronary heart disease, social integration is posited to be a biological link between social isolation and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, social support affects physical perception. In a landmark study, researchers demonstrated that people accompanied by a supportive friend or those who imagined a supportive friend, estimated a hill to be less steep when compared to people who were alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mental health, like physical health, is more than the sum of functioning or malfunctioning parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the second level of analysis, the complex bio-social interplay scaffolding mental illness points to the fundamentally chemical underpinnings of human thinking and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With recent advances in neuroscience like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-NMfp13Uug&quot;&gt;Clarity&lt;/a&gt;, we are now able to make the brain optically transparent, without having to section or reconstruct it, in order to examine the neuronal networks, subcellular structures, and more. In short, we can examine mental illness from a biological perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depth and complexity of the bio-social root of mental illness, however, paints a more nuanced picture than discussed thus far. With such pioneering work, there is an increasingly popular assumption that the brain is the most important level at which to analyze human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this vein, mental illness perpetuates itself by virtue of the fact that people often consider it to be biologically determined. In turn, a ‘trait-like’ view of mental illness establishes a status quo of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/04/stigma-towards-mental-health-stigma-impacts-vocation/&quot;&gt;mental health stigma&lt;/a&gt; by reducing empathy. Such explanations overemphasize constant factors such as biology and underemphasize modulating factors such as the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the third level of analysis, the obsession with seeing mental health in terms of mental illness reveals the fallible assumption that mental health is simply the absence of mental disorder. However, the problematic landscape of mental health draws on a far wider set of working assumptions. That is, mental health, like physical health, is more than the sum of the functioning or malfunctioning parts. It is an overall well-being that must be considered in light of unique differences between physical health, cognition, and emotions, which can be lost in a solely global evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why do we as a society ponder solving mental illness, which should have been targeted long ago, far more than we consider improving mental health? In part, because when we think of mental health, we think of raising the mean positive mental health of a population, more than closing the implementation gap between prevention, promotion, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumulatively, social environments are the lubricating oil to biological predispositions, which influence mental health, such that mental health and physical health should be considered holistically. In this vein, national mental health policies should not be solely concerned with mental disorders, to the detriment of mental health promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth considering how mental health issues can be targeted using proactive behavioral programs. To achieve this, it is pivotal to involve all relevant government sectors such as education, labor, justice, and welfare sectors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a diverse range of existing players, many nonprofits’, educational institutions’, and research groups’ efforts contribute to the solution landscape of mental health promotion. In Ireland, for example, schools have mental health promotional activities such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/11/20/re-learning-the-joy-of-living-with-journaling-and-meditation/&quot;&gt;breathing exercises&lt;/a&gt; and anger management programs. Nonprofits around the world are increasingly seeing the value of community development programmes and capacity building (strengthening the skills of communities in so they can overcome the causes of their isolation). In addition, businesses are incorporating stress management into their office culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think of raising the mean positive mental health of a population, more than closing the implementation gap between prevention, promotion and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit to empower people to help themselves joins up these social ventures to teach us that promoting mental health is optimized when it is preventative, occurring before mental illness emerges, and when it is linked to practical skills within a community. Furthermore, these social ventures exemplify how different types of efforts (government, nonprofit, business etc.) cater to different populations, from children to corporates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these social ventures bring hope to the future and underscore the importance of sustainable change, there are still too few programs effectively targeting people, who want to maximize already existent positive mental health not just to resolve or cope with mental health issues. If we continue to take such pride in our successful problem finding and solving of mental illness that we ignore mental illness prevention and mental health promotion, we are at risk of increasing the problem we are trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/convergence-of-synaptic-signals-is-mediated-by-a-protein-critical-for-learning-and-memory/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h4&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience show that protein Kinase C is a novel information integrator, keeping tabs on the recent history of neighboring synapses while simultaneously monitoring local synaptic input&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the brain, is a complex symphony of perfectly coordinated signaling. Hundreds of different molecules amplify, modify and carry information from tiny synaptic compartments all the way through the entire length of a neuron. The precise interplay of these proteins is critical for normal neuronal function; ultimately allowing the brain to achieve feats like cognition, decision making, and sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the lab of Ryohei Yasuda at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), study the elaborate nexus of signaling proteins involved in learning and memory; looking at a unique process called synaptic plasticity, the innate ability of a neural synapse to either strengthen or weaken. Understanding how proteins behave during plasticity is key to unlocking how we learn and how memories are formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in Nature Neuroscience in July 2018, Dr. Lesley Colgan, a Research Fellow in the Yasuda Lab and leading author of the paper, delves into the role that Protein Kinase C (PKC) plays in synaptic plasticity. PKC represents an entire family of 12 distinct kinases, that propagate a biochemical signal through the phosphorylation of target proteins they interact with. While previously implicated in synaptic plasticity, engineering tools sensitive enough to study PKC in the brain has been a major challenge. Yasuda’s team developed a host of sensors that can track the activity of PKCs with unprecedented specificity and sensitivity, probing when and where activation occurs as well as how these enzymes turn on and off. With these powerful sensors, they have been able to look more closely at the role that PKC plays at the single synapse level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One enzyme in the PKC family, PKCα, plays a direct role in facilitating synaptic plasticity. When PKCα activity is perturbed, plasticity is subsequently disrupted; demonstrating that the protein is a critical first step in the initial molecular cascade. PKCα also has very robust activation and is rather spine specific, confining its activity to only the stimulated spine and not spreading to the surrounding dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique discovery of the study, found that PKCα acts to integrate two temporally distinctive signaling pathways both known to be critical for synaptic plasticity. The first is BDNF mediated, a slower, diffuse signal developing over minutes and the second, is NMDA receptor mediated calcium influx, a spine-specific signal occurring in a matter of milliseconds and necessary to begin the rapid molecular cascade of synaptic plasticity. Adaptably responding to both of these signals, PKCα is able to sample recent synaptic history and integrate it with current synaptic events, enabling complex processing of information at the single spine level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating these intriguing findings further, the team was able to successfully link molecules to memory, uncovering that PKC&lt;span&gt;α&lt;/span&gt; is required for efficiency of learning. Mice with PKC&lt;span&gt;α&lt;/span&gt; removed from the brain, take a significantly longer amount of time to become proficient at a learning task than counterparts containing intact PKC&lt;span&gt;α&lt;/span&gt; protein. Despite this lengthier learning curve, if given additional training, mice lacking PKC&lt;span&gt;α&lt;/span&gt; will eventually learn the task just as well as wild type mice; supporting the notion that PKC&lt;span&gt;α&lt;/span&gt; is critical for encoding a memory but may not play a significant role in the recall of a memory once it’s established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work represents a substantial advancement in the field, providing integral tools that will enable the disentanglement of complex signaling related to learning and memory. According to Dr. Colgan, “These newly developed sensors will have broad usage in neuroscience and cell biology alike, allowing the study of many complex signaling pathways that PKC has a hand in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above image:&lt;br /&gt;
Model of integration of TrkB and calcium signals to induce PKCα activation in paired and unpaired subthreshold stimulations. A subthreshold stimulus that was unable to induce plasticity was given alone (unpaired) or after a nearby plasticity-inducing stimulation (paired).  Unpaired, the stimulus could not activate PKCa or induce plasticity.  However, when paired with recent plasticity in a nearby spine, which induces a long-lasting, spreading TrkB activity, this same subthreshold stimulus led to PKCa activation and plasticity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PKCα integrates spatiotemporally distinct Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and autocrine BDNF signaling to facilitate synaptic plasticity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/AdobeStock_149171725-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a common psychological disorder that affects 121 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of disability when measured by years lived with disability (YLDs). Rising rates of depression diagnoses among youth, with about 20% experiencing depression before adulthood, have led many counties to prioritize initiatives that enhance prevention, early identification, and treatment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest in activities of daily living, impacting overall health and wellbeing. The common misinterpretation of depressed states as transient “normal” phases of adolescence combined with widespread stigma have contributed to the current situation where the vast majority of depressed youth are not being treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of depression among youth can lead to substance (mis)use, decreased quality of life and suicide. Furthermore, young people who experience depression are also at increased risk of having poor health and economic outcomes in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factors that increase the risk of depression in young people include abuse and neglect, chronic physical illness, family history of mental illness, other mental health problems and the experience of stressful life events. It has also been found that female youth develop depression twice as often as young men, although some of this difference is due to the way researchers ask questions when determining symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what about sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is essential for health and proper sleep for young people is critical for proper growth and it it is recommended that young people aged 13-18 years &lt;a href=&quot;https://sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times&quot;&gt;sleep 8 to 10 hours&lt;/a&gt; per night. Yet, getting enough sleep is not commonly talked about as a potential determinant of youth depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the existing studies look at gender differences despite the fact that women and men are known to differ in the developmental course of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is a critical period of development that is marked by substantial reductions to slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep, increases in sleep disturbance, a circadian shift to an evening chronotype and a shortening of total duration of sleep. These neuro-endocrine changes often lead to young people lacking adequate amounts of total sleep. negative consequences of sleep deprivation include mood disturbances, poor academic performance, weight gain, increased food intake, substance use and other poor health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between short sleep (i.e. poor quantity) and depression in young people has not been well studied. Although some investigators have used prospective study designs that allow for some inference about causality, the majority of work in this area involves cross-sectional designs which measure both sleep deprivation and depression at the same point in time so there is no way to know if disrupted sleep precedes the emergence of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the studies that are somewhat better designed to assess causality frequently measure sleep problems only once and then follow people over time to identify risk of developing depression. Although not conclusive, the results of these types of studies suggest that short sleep duration precedes depression in young people but not the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the existing studies look at gender differences despite the fact that women and men are known to differ in the developmental course of depression, and they also experience distinct risk factors that are known to influence depression because of their biology and social status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to fill this gap in evidence using data that was collected multiple times from a large &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basus.ca/&quot;&gt;group of young people in British Columbia (BC), Canada&lt;/a&gt;. We used answers that young people gave to questions about their sleep and awake times to determine whether they were sleep deprived and we calculated this at three time points, roughly 6 months apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design allowed us to determine the extent to which they were chronically sleep deprived. We used this information to study the cumulative effect of chronic sleep deprivation (compared to occasional or no history of sleep deprivation) on the risk of depression from a gender perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our work adds new evidence on the role of repeated sleep deprivation in young people on their risk of depression and how the effect differs by gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hypothesis was that chronic sleep deprivation, defined as less than 8 hours per weeknight, would be linked to higher depression levels, and that the relationship would vary between young women and young men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results showed that cumulative sleep deprivation in young women was linked to higher depression scores at the study follow-up, but there was no clear relationship among young men. The size of the effect we found was initially medium when we used simple statistical models of the relationship; however, it was smaller when we also accounted for a number of the factors that are known to influence both depression and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work adds new evidence on the role of repeated sleep deprivation in young people on their risk of depression and how the effect differs by gender. We believe this is an important area of research that needs more attention, both in terms of thinking about these relationships and in terms of measuring them in a rigorous way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think it is important for young women to be supported in achieving the recommended amount of sleep as a potentially important way of promoting mental health among young people.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;This study is the first estimate of the impact of open data on the Ukrain- ian economy and finds that open data has already contributed over USD 700 million in 2017. If the open data movement continues to gath- er momentum in Ukraine, we estimate that it could contribute up to USD 1.4 billion to the Ukrainian economy by 2025, representing 0.92% of Ukrainian GDP, through a combination of direct and indirect benefits.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Abstract: &quot;Librarians in Sweden are facing huge challenges in meeting the demands of their organisations and users. This article looks at four key areas: coping with open science/open access initiatives; increasing demands from researchers for support doing systematic reviews; understanding user experiences in Swedish health science libraries; and the consequences of expanding roles for recruitment and continuing professional development. With regard to changing roles, there is an increasing shift from the generalist towards the expert role. The authors raise the issue as to how to prepare those new to the profession to the changing environment of health science libraries.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In spring 2017, the editors-in-chief and editorial board of the Springer-owned Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics decided to leave in order to found a new, free, open access journal called Algebraic Combinatorics. Our new journal started accepting submissions in the summer, published its first issue in January 2018, with the second issue to follow in a few days as I write this in March 2018.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://doi.org/10.5334/csci.106"/>
		<id>http://doi.org/10.5334/csci.106</id>
		<updated>2018-07-16T10:06:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Abstract: &quot;This paper examines the development of open knowledge in China through two case studies: the development of Chinese open access (OA) journals, and national-level OA repositories. Open access and open knowledge are emerging as a site of both grass-roots activism, and top-down intervention in the practices of scholarship and scholarly publishing in China. Although the language, vision and strategies of the global open knowledge movement are undoubtedly present, so too are the messy realities of open access and open knowledge innovation in a local context. In attempting to position open access developments in China within a diverse and contested global landscape of open knowledge innovation we draw on Moore’s (2017) conception of open access as a boundary object: an object that is understood differently within individual communities but which maintains enough structure to be understood between communities (Moore 2017; Star and Griesemer 1989). Viewed as a boundary object, the concept of open knowledge is making it possible for China to engage with the global open knowledge movement, as a beneficiary of the innovation of others, and as an open knowledge innovator in its own right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;Building on open educational resources (OER), open educational practices seek to fully use the potential inherent in OER to support learning and to help students both contribute to knowledge and construct their own learning pathways. Such open practices provide the architecture and philosophical underpinning for fulfilling the promise of using OER to expand collaborative, inclusive, accessible, and active learning and related pedagogy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;This exciting new role has been created to support and develop the repository infrastructures of the Library and the University of Warwick. Initially working with the University’s publications and research data repository (WRAP), you will be involved with developing our current repository to support the University’s crucial REF 2021 submission.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Priorities over the coming period will include further development of the University’s repository platform (currently EPrints) to support and enhance user experience, staff processes and reporting, as well as support for the REF 2021 submission. The post will be responsible for contributing to the stable running and security of the software as well as planning for the long term software sustainability of the service. This will involve working with the Digital Development Manager and the E-Repositories Manager to develop robust user requirements and appropriate user journeys for the service and evaluate available systems against these requirements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;In the meantime, we already work for open data for the public good, since this would be the fuel of the future and science. Blockchain could play an important role to give transparency in the use of our data for science, to know who when where and why is using it....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Audiobook sales are booming, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebookseller.com/news/audio-sales-double-five-years-764431&quot;&gt;almost doubling in the UK&lt;/a&gt; over the past five years. Some are now sophisticated, being voiced by multiple actors and featuring extensive sound effects. But even single-narrator audiobooks are, it’s been argued, more cognitively and emotionally engaging than print – in part because a listener can’t slow down, as they can with a print book.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a writer whose latest psychology-themed novel &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/she-myself-and-i&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;She, Myself and I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now being produced as an audiobook, I can’t help wondering about the benefits, and the costs. Personally, I like to be able to control my pace through a print book, to re-read sentences or paragraphs that I particularly enjoy or that I don’t quite process properly on a first read.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as Daniel Richardson at UCL, and fellow researchers, point out in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/20/351148&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, available as a pre-print on the &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; service, “Our oldest narratives date back many thousands of years and pre-date the advent of writing… For the majority of human history, stories were synonymous with oral tradition; audiences listened to a story-teller imparting a tale.” Humans did not evolve to read, so perhaps there’s something primordially special about listening to a story. But, as the researchers go on to write, “in the modern era, video has emerged as a major narrative tool as well.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which is more engaging – video or audio? That’s the focus of the new paper. And I’m intrigued. I’ve also sold TV rights to the novel, and TV, of course, is the medium of mass-appeal. If my book is ultimately turned into a TV series, might viewers become more involved in the story than my audiobook listeners?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34246&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video offers more information than audio, the researchers point out (while two people both hearing “&lt;i&gt;The house was ablaze&lt;/i&gt;” would imagine slightly different things, watching a film showing a house on fire leaves nothing to the imagination.) Oral stories might therefore elicit more engagement, as the listener has to construct a personalised interpretation of the narrative. But because audio is also more demanding than video, is there a bigger risk that listeners will lose interest in the story, and switch off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers asked 102 men and women, aged 18-55, to wear a wrist sensor that captured their heart rate, sweating and wrist temperature while they listened to and watched a series of emotionally-charged scenes.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were a mix of audio and film-version extracts from eight works of fiction, including &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/i&gt; by Jane Austen, &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt; by Dan Brown, and &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; by George R.R. Martin. The order of the presentations, and whether a particular story was presented as a video or as an audiobook extract, varied across participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of each trial, participants completed a questionnaire that assessed four aspects of their perceived involvement in the story: their emotional engagement; their understanding of the narrative; their attentional focus; and the “narrative presence” (indicating to what extent they agreed or disagreed with “At times, the story was closer to me than the real world,” for example). &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the participants reported &lt;i&gt;feeling&lt;/i&gt; more&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;engaged in the videos, their heart rates, body temperatures and skin conductance readings were all higher while they were listening to the audio. Increased heart rate was taken to indicate greater cognitive effort (there were no differences in levels of fidgeting between the audio and video trials), especially given the other data: the skin conductance and temperature readings suggested that the participants were more emotionally involved when listening to audio, the researchers argued.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper has not been peer-reviewed yet. And, due to sensor failure, the researchers were not able to gather the full set of physiological recordings for all of the participants (they got electrodermal data for only 62, for instance). But if as this work suggests, people are at a physiological level more emotionally engaged by audio than watching film, this is good news for novelists. People might love watching TV dramas, but, in getting people more involved in a story, the form of the novel – whether in print or audio – reigns supreme.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the occasion of the annual conference of the LIgue of European Research Libraries (LIBER), organized in Lille from July 4th to 6th, the Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation Frédérique Vidal delivered a speech very offensive about the need to develop open access to scientific publications. And this, to the detriment of a &quot; &lt;em&gt; historical editorial system&lt;/em&gt; [...] &lt;em&gt;becoming obsolete in the age of the web and digital ubiquity&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Frédérique Vidal was at the annual meeting of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://libereurope.eu/&quot;&gt;European League of Research Libraries&lt;/a&gt; to announce the national plan for open science. And the minister says it unambiguously she wants &quot;Make France the country of open science.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/actualite/ce-que-la-loi-numerique-apporte-a-l-enseignement-superieur-et-la-recherche.html&quot;&gt;Digital Republic Act of Axelle Lemaire&lt;/a&gt; (Digital Secretary of the previous government) in 2016, this plan shows a clear commitment to research accessible to all. While the Digital Republic Act was an incentive and clearly allowed French researchers who wanted to publish the results of their research without access constraint, the new plan would be much more directive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;France has adopted a national plan for &quot;open science&quot; aimed in particular to make scientific research, data and publications available to all for free &quot;to open the doors, to lower the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan includes setting up &quot;an obligation to disseminate in open access articles and books resulting from research funded by public projects,&quot; said Minister of Higher Education and Research Frédérique Vidal occasion of a trip to Lille.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We still have to pay too much to access the publications of our researchers,&quot; she said in a speech to AFP. &quot;This severely limits the potential impact of our research on campuses around the world, on society, on industry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers publish their results in scientific journals and journals, mostly accessible only against payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;While false news is very easily accessible, scientific publications are protected behind tolls that are all barriers to access to knowledge,&quot; said the minister. &quot;We need to be able to disseminate our results quickly, transparently and completely to all citizens Open science is the ideal vehicle for knowledge in the face of rumors&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A fund for open science&quot; will be created and &quot;invest in an open edition&quot; controlled by the scientific community, according to the minister.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;The National Plan for Open Science: the results of scientific research open to all, unhindered, without delay, without payment&lt;/strong&gt; 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Open Science Plan announced by Frédérique Vidal on July 4, 2018, mandates open access for publications and data from project-funded research. It sets up an Open Science Committee and supports major landscape structuring initiatives related to publications and data. Finally, it has a training component and an international component that are essential for the mobilization of scientific communities and the influence of France in this landscape in the process of being set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Open science is not a fad, it's not a discipline, it's a new paradigm, so it has its new practices and new skills, and I will pay particular attention to what these skills are considered. as part of the initial baggage of young researchers Open science will not be the business of a small group of specialists, it will have to permeate the whole world of research.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;From Google's English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wednesday 4 July 2018, Frédérique VIDAL, Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation unveiled the &lt;strong&gt;National Open Science Plan&lt;/strong&gt; at the annual conference of the League of European Research Libraries ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://libereurope.eu/&quot;&gt;LIBER&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France adopts an ambitious policy in 3 axes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Generalize open access to publications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Structure and open research data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Join a sustainable dynamic, European and international&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is worth € 5.4m the first year, then € 3.4m per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full national plan for open science is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid132529/le-plan-national-pour-la-science-ouverte-les-resultats-de-la-recherche-scientifique-ouverts-a-tous-sans-entrave-sans-delai-sans-paiement.html&quot;&gt;website of the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 A paper just published reports that Republicans are more likely to have used the adultery website Ashley Madison than Democrats, while Libertarians were even more likely to do so.



That's a claim that could ruffle some feathers, but the way in which the researchers conducted this study might be even more controversial. That's because this paper is based on the 2015 Ashley Madison data leak, which exposed the personal data, including names and credit-card details, of millions of registered</content>

Detailed analysis of an organism's &lt;b&gt;natural behavior&lt;/b&gt; is indispensable for progress in understanding brain-behavior relationships. Claims that optogenetic and other manipulations of a neuronal  population can demonstrate that it is “N&amp;amp;S” for a complex behavior  have also been challenged. &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-57363-2_11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gomez-Marin (2017)&lt;/a&gt; pulled no punches and stated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;I argue that to upgrade intervention to explanation is prone to logical fallacies, interpretational leaps and carries a weak explanatory force, thus settling and maintaining low standards for intelligibility in neuroscience. To claim that behavior is explained by a “necessary and sufficient” neural circuit is, at best, misleading.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest entry into this fault-fest goes further, indicating that most N&amp;amp;S claims in biology violate the principles of formal logic and should be called ‘misapplied-N&amp;amp;S’ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01677063.2018.1468443&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yoshihara &amp;amp; Yoshihara, 2018&lt;/a&gt;). They say the use of “necessary and sufficient” terminology should be banned and replaced with “indispensable and inducing” (except for a handful of instances). &lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lYEItOomiC4/W0k1dhj-8bI/AAAAAAAAMlQ/qaA_BD6SMDA6IMfe9QtLjFsHg-vfVXwHQCLcBGAs/s1600/N%2526S%2Bin%2Bformal%2Blogic.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;537&quot; data-original-width=&quot;479&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lYEItOomiC4/W0k1dhj-8bI/AAAAAAAAMlQ/qaA_BD6SMDA6IMfe9QtLjFsHg-vfVXwHQCLcBGAs/s400/N%2526S%2Bin%2Bformal%2Blogic.png&quot; width=&quot;356&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;modified from Fig. 1A (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01677063.2018.1468443&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yoshihara &amp;amp; Yoshihara, 2018&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;. The relationship between squares and rectangles as a typical example of true &lt;b&gt;necessary&lt;/b&gt; (being a rectangle; pale green) and &lt;b&gt;sufficient&lt;/b&gt; condition (being a square; magenta) in formal logic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N&amp;amp;S claims are &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_sdt=1,5&amp;amp;q=optogenetics+%22necessary+and+sufficient%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_vis=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;about 1,800 results&quot;&gt;very popular&lt;/a&gt; in optogenetics, which has become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;uses light to control neurons that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels&quot;&gt;crucial technique&lt;/a&gt; in neuroscience. But demonstrating true N&amp;amp;S is nearly impossible, because the terminology disregards: activity in the rest of the brain, whether all the activated neurons are “necessary” (instead of only a subset), what actually happens under natural conditions (rather than artificially induced), the requirement of equivalence, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01677063.2018.1468443&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yoshihara &amp;amp; Yoshihara (2018)&lt;/a&gt; are especially disturbed by the incorrect use of “sufficient”, which leads to results being overstated and misinterpreted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The main problem comes from the word ‘sufficient,’ which is often used to emphasize that artificial expression of only a single gene or activation of only a single neuron can cause a substantial and presumably relevant effect on the whole process of interest. Although it may be sufficient as an experimental manipulation for triggering the effect, it is not actually sufficient for executing the whole effect itself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for optogenetics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rather, the importance of ‘sufficiency’ experiments lies in demonstrating a &lt;b&gt;causal&lt;/b&gt; link through optogenetic activation of neurons... Thus, words such as &lt;b&gt;triggers&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;promotes&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;induces&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;switches&lt;/b&gt;, or&lt;b&gt; initiates &lt;/b&gt;may better reflect or express the desired nuance without creating such confusion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01677063.2018.1468443&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Y &amp;amp; Y (2018)&lt;/a&gt; aren't shy about naming names in their Commentary, and even say that misapplied-N&amp;amp;S has generated unproductive and misleading studies that offer no scientific insight whatsoever. Although one could say that N&amp;amp;S has a different meaning in biology, or is merely a figure of speech, such strong statements have consequences for the future directions of a field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/behaviOrganisms/status/1001538334982852609&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BoOrg Lab&lt;/a&gt; for the link to Gomez-Marin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“...neurons necessary and sufficient for inter-male aggression are located  within the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamic  nucleus (VMHvl)...” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;One of the instances uses the old discredited “command neuron” concept of Ikeda &amp;amp; Wiersma (1964).

 How long should a retraction take? That’s a complex question, of course, depending on how long the alleged issues with a paper take to be investigated, whether authors — and their lawyers — fight tooth-and-nail against a retraction, and other factors.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Eciton_burchellii_army_ants-e1531393107574-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists interested in the evolution of brains often use comparisons among species to explore how the nervous system is shaped by, and adapts to, its environment. Brain tissue is very expensive, and so investment in brains (or in particular brain regions) is expected to closely match the mental or psychological challenges a species confronts: there should be just enough brain power and brain tissue to get by, and no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to extend this approach to ask whether members of the same species might differ predictably in brain structure and brain investment, in association with differences in behavioral demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super-organisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal societies, including human societies, can be complex to navigate. When interacting with an array of social partners and enemies, social smarts can be of great value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some animal societies have been shaped by evolution such that internal conflict is minimized; this often happens when the group members are closely related, and when strong competition among groups favors group coordination and performance. Some features of these societies can then evolve in response to natural selection at the level of the group, rather than the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When individual interests align with the group as a whole, we can think of the society as a super-organism. We can then explore how natural selection on groups might drive the evolution of specializations among group members. We expect these specializations to enhance group performance or efficiency. Could group selection actually favor a reduction of brain investment in some group members?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing castes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the superorganism framework to study patterns of brain investment among the members of insect societies, particularly, of army ants. Social insect colonies are famously divided into castes: classes of individuals that play distinct roles in the social group (for example, think of the reproductive queens versus the sterile, helping workers in a honey bee colony).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Army ants have some of the most dramatic, complex caste systems known: not only are their queens distinctly different, the worker force is divided into three or even four distinct body types, each of which performs different jobs for the colony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10380&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10380&quot; height=&quot;554&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/army-ant-and-foraging-ant.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A foraging medium-sized worker (gray arrow) and a soldier (white arrow) of the army ant &lt;em&gt;Eciton burchellii cupiens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among army ant castes, the soldiers in the genus &lt;em&gt;Eciton&lt;/em&gt; stand out as being rather behaviorally limited. Soldiers are specialized defenders. They have large, muscle-filled heads that drive long, powerful mouthparts shaped like ice tongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are effective at tracking down, biting, and stinging enemies – mostly birds and mammals, including field biologists. But they do little else. Soldiers cannot carry the young during colony emigrations, or hunt and kill prey. Soldiers cannot even feed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do soldiers have reduced brain investment, as expected based on their simple behavioral repertoire? Our data suggest the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10381&quot; style=&quot;width: 686px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10381 size-full&quot; height=&quot;496&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Same-scale-3-D-reconstructions-of-head-capsules-e1531392762587.jpg&quot; width=&quot;676&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Same-scale 3-D reconstructions of head capsules and brains of army ant (&lt;em&gt;Eciton burchellii parvispinum&lt;/em&gt;) worker (A) and soldier (B). The scale bar represents 0.5 mm. Brain structures are the colored bodies in the center of each head capsule. Dark blue: learning/memory region; Light blue: chemical processing region.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured head size and brain region volumes in several species of &lt;em&gt;Eciton&lt;/em&gt; army ants, comparing workers of different sizes and soldiers in each species. Even though worker brain volume increased with body size, that increase slowed or stopped in the soldiers; even though soldiers were larger than the workers, their brains were similar in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, two key brain regions were smaller than expected based on soldiers’ overall brain size: a region that processes chemical information, and another region that is critical for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are exciting because they support the idea that natural selection for colony efficiency can favor the evolution of reduced brain investment in some group members, when a caste has limited behavioral demands. It appears&lt;em&gt; Eciton &lt;/em&gt;soldiers give new meaning to the term, “meat head.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, more people than ever are locked up in prisons – estimated to be in excess of 11 million people, up by almost 20 per cent since the turn of the millennium (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/world_prison_population_list_11th_edition_0.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;). According to a recent House of Commons &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/Allen_Dempsey_2016.pdf&quot;&gt;Briefing Paper&lt;/a&gt; the rate of increase is even higher than this in the UK where prison populations are at a record high. Many of these incarcerated individuals have intensifying mental health needs – for instance, the same briefing paper reports that UK rates of self-harm in prisoners were 25 per cent higher in 2015 than in 2014. Ahead of this week’s meeting of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/all-party-parliamentary-group-psychology&quot;&gt;All Party Parliamentary Group for Psychology&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of Mental Health in the Criminal Justice System, here we provide a digest of research into the mental health of prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34216&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prisoners are at much higher risk of mental health problems than the general population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22550330&quot;&gt;a systematic review&lt;/a&gt; published in 2012, involving data from over 30,000 prisoners worldwide from 24 different countries, around 12 per cent of prisoners have a diagnosis of depression and nearly 4 per cent have a diagnosis of psychosis (compared with approximately 4 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, in the general population). Other mental health conditions are also more common among prison populations than the general public, including substance misuse and personality disorders. The statistics show that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180411-locked-up-and-vulnerable-when-prison-makes-things-worse&quot;&gt;women prisoners seem to be at especially high risk of mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prisoners are at elevated risk of suicide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These greater mental health vulnerabilities also manifest in much higher suicide rates among prison populations than among the general public. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036617304303&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; published last year analysed prison suicides across 24 countries between 2011 to 2014. This revealed a threefold increased suicide risk among male prisoners, and a ninefold increased risk of suicide among female prisoners, compared with the general population. The study also measured a number of prison factors to see if these correlated with suicide rates, such as over-crowding and the staff-prisoner ratios, but none of them did. “There are no simple ecological explanations for prison suicide,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unresolved issue is whether prison causes mental health problems or people with mental health problems are more likely to go to prison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS2215-0366(16)30142-0&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; described this question as a “key issue” for the field, citing in favour of the “importation” argument two studies that suggested offending rates are higher than average among people with a diagnosis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25110636&quot;&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00aadc;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;depression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which could account for the elevated rates of these diagnoses among prison populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a small British &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/prospective-cohort-study-of-mental-health-during-imprisonment/76CC2340DD5DB3D2723EE81D91276020/core-reader&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2011 found that rates of depression actually decreased, and rates of psychosis remained stable, among the prisoners they followed for two months from the beginning of their sentence. “It appears that the first 2 months of imprisonment do not have a universally detrimental impact on mental health, even among those with pre-existing mental illnesses,” the researchers said (other researchers have previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17449200701682436&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the relative safety of prisons, the structure, and access to psychiatric care could be responsible for symptom improvements, and there is even research on &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306624X14548531&quot;&gt;post-traumatic growth in prison&lt;/a&gt; through finding meaning in the experience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, however, that the pattern in the 2011 study was somewhat different for women prisoners, who did not show declines in symptoms. “The notion that women are differently and disproportionately affected by imprisonment is well supported in the literature,” the researchers added. The study also showed that symptom prevalence among prisoners was highest during the first week in prison: “Our findings confirm that the first week of custody continues to represent a period of heightened distress and risk among all newly received prisoners,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Several pre-incarceration factors have been found to correlate with increased risk of prisoner mental health problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the debate continues around whether and what factors of prison increase risk of mental illness, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160252717301255&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published this year that assessed over 750 prisoners from two UK prisons found multiple “imported factors” that were associated with increased risk of having a mental health problem in prison (in this study, around 40 per cent the prisoners had a mental health problem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These factors included: describing oneself a worrier; being impulsive; having difficulty getting on with others; having been a victim of sexual abuse in childhood (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918302137&quot;&gt;also&lt;/a&gt;); and having learning difficulties at school. “[P]ersonality type may be one area well worth exploring when carrying out initial intake assessments and designing regime or individual sentence plans, as it appears certain dispositions may be useful predictive markers [for risk of mental health issues],” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counter-intuitively, having a previous prison sentence, past substance abuse problems and being unemployed prior to prison were all associated with lower risk of mental health problems in prison (at a statistically significant level or showing a trend in that direction). “A possible explanation for this finding is that the presence of these factors may make the adoption of a prisonized identity an easier process, which in turn eases mental stress,” the researchers said (for more on the processes of “prisonisation” – i.e. how prison changes people – see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180430-the-unexpected-ways-prison-time-changes-people&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prisoners with mental health problems are more likely to perpetuate and be the victims of violence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A US Department of Justice report (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) found that prisoners with mental health problems were more likely to have been charged with physical or verbal assault and more likely to have been injured in a fight, compared with prisoners without mental health issues. Other research has highlighted how prisoners with mental health problems are more likely to be victimised: for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2811043/&quot;&gt;another US study&lt;/a&gt; found that 1 in 12 male prisoners with a mental health diagnosis reported sexual victimisation by another inmate, compared with 1 in 33 male prisoners without a mental health diagnosis. Prisoners with mental health problems are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836899/&quot;&gt;also at increased risk of physical assault by others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a lack of quality research on interventions for prisoners with mental health needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the high rates of mental health problems among prison populations, there is a worrying lack of large-scale intervention studies. The recent &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5008459/#R17&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of mental health issues in prisons stated that this is likely due to organisational challenges, lack of funding, and “a perceived division of prisoner health from public health in general”. There is some limited evidence for beneficial effects for prisoners of programmes based around CBT, DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) and Yoga. “But the effect sizes are not large; [it remains unclear] whether they would hold in better quality designs (e.g. using active controls and not waiting list or treatment as usual controls), and it is uncertain whether any improvements are sustained,” the review states. It goes on to recommend that “More evidence is required to determine which psychological therapies are most effective for mental health problems in prison, and whether they can be provided in a group-based formats.” Findings from the community may not generalise to the community, the review authors warn, because of the unique challenges in prison of “the increased structures, different rules, housing, and access to drugs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the prison drug problem, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprisons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/07/HMIP-AR_2014-15_TSO_Final1.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales warned about the “rapid increase in the availability of new psychoactive substances (new drugs such as ‘Spice’ and ‘Black Mamba’ that are developed or chosen to mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as cannabis, heroin or amphetamines and may have unpredictable and life-threatening effects)…” and it stated that these drugs have been linked with “problems such as bullying, debt and medical emergencies requiring hospitalisation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.multipledrafts.com/&quot;&gt;Dan Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid all the talk of a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;replication crisis&lt;/a&gt;” in psychology, here’s a rare good news story – a new project has found that a sub-field of the discipline, known as “experimental philosophy” or X-phi, is producing results that are impressively robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current crisis in psychology was largely precipitated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;a mass replication attempt&lt;/a&gt; published by the Open Science Collaboration (OSC) project in 2015. Of 100 previously published significant findings, only 39 per cent replicated unambiguously, rising to 47 per cent on more relaxed criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a paper in &lt;em&gt;Review of Philosophy and Psychology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-018-0400-9&quot;&gt;has trained the replicability lens on the burgeoning field of experimental philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. Born roughly 15 years ago, X-Phi takes the tools of contemporary psychology and applies them to unravelling how people think about many of the major topics of Western philosophy, from the metaphysics of free will and the nature of the self, to morality and the problem of consciousness.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34238&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8284.00419&quot;&gt;earliest and most well-known findings from the field&lt;/a&gt;. Back in 2003, Joshua Knobe, now at Yale University, set out to study what determines whether we describe the outcome of someone’s behaviour as intentional or not. Knobe ran two short vignettes by his participants. One described the CEO of a company being brought a new business plan by his VPs that would cause harm to the environment. The CEO says “I don’t care about harming the environment, go ahead”. The project proceeds and the environment is duly hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, most people say that the CEO intentionally harmed the environment. But switch the word “harm” to “help” and now people are reluctant to say that the CEO intentionally helped the environment, even though in both cases the CEO was indifferent to harming or helping the environment as a side effect of his business activities. This asymmetry, known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-22/edition-8/good-bad-and-intentional&quot;&gt;Knobe effect&lt;/a&gt;, revealed how moral considerations affect our deployment of ostensibly non-moral concepts, like intentionality.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-Phi has generated great excitement making it essential to see whether the pall of the replicability crisis darkens this field too. So the X-Phi Replicability Project (XRP) – a collaboration between twenty research teams in eight countries, devised by Brent Strickland of the Institut Jean Nicod, Paris, France and led by Florian Cova of the Swiss Centre for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva, Switzerland – set about re-running a representative sample of 40 X-Phi studies to see how the field is holding up (the sample comprised the most cited X-Phi papers from 2003-2015, two random papers for each year, and a few extra to bring the total to 40).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous criteria that can be used for determining whether a study replicates or not. The XRP used three: a subjective assessment by the replicating team; whether the replication achieved a statistically significant result in the same direction as the original study; and whether the effect sizes of the original and replication studies were comparable. The XRP found that X-Phi studies replicated 78 per cent of the time according to the first two criteria, and 71 per cent of the time judged by the third – way better than the 39-47 per cent for psychology as whole, although other specific sub-fields like &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/05/these-nine-cognitive-psychology-findings-all-passed-a-stringent-test-of-their-replicability/&quot;&gt;cognitive psychology&lt;/a&gt; have also reported promising results.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s wonderful news,” says Knobe. “And it’s a bit ironic, because the whole approach of X-Phi was modelled on the techniques used in the rest of psychology, yet we ended up with this higher replicability!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is X-Phi doing so well? A big part of the field’s success seems to come from the kinds of studies it focuses on. Specifically, 78 per cent of the studies in the XRP sample were “content-based”, meaning they looked at how participants’ behaviour, beliefs or judgments changed depending on the task or stimuli they were given (e.g., Knobe’s changing of the word “harm” to “help” to elicit different judgments about intentional behaviour), rather than being observational or demographic-based (looking at aspects of individuals that predict differences in outcome), for instance. And such content-based studies – whether in psychology as a whole or in X-Phi – replicate better than other kinds of study: 90 per cent replicated in the XRP sample (compared to 21-31 per cent for other designs), and 65 per cent in the OSC sample. Notably, content-based studies comprised just 34 per cent on the OSC sample – less than half the proportion found in X-Phi – giving X-Phi a higher overall replicability rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the effect sizes studied in the predominantly content-based studies of X-Phi might typically be larger than in the rest of contemporary psychology – and as the OSC found, studies that report large effect sizes tend to replicate better. One reason for this could be that the effects X-Phi explores are powerful enough to be available to introspection. The Knobe effect, for example, has an intuitive, natural feel to it – one that Knobe sensed but needed to confirm empirically. And the XRP found that early X-Phi studies tended to produce especially large effect sizes, adding plausibility to the idea that they tapped into low-hanging, introspectively visible psychological fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cluster of other factors may be giving X-Phi a boost. X-Phi studies tend to be cheaper and easier to run than in many areas of psychology. Often, all you need are some written vignettes and a few questions about them, and a way of delivering this material to people – a process made easy by the widely used Amazon Mechanical Turk survey platform. That means that researchers may be less invested in a given study, and feel less pressure to “p-hack” the data to produce a positive, publishable, but ultimately unreliable, result. This take is backed up by the XRP’s statistical analysis that found less evidence of p-hacking in X-Phi compared to psychology generally. What’s more, X-Phi researchers also seem to be more comfortable publishing null or negative results: while such papers comprised just 3 per cent of the total in the OSC, they made up 10 per cent of XRP’s sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of X-Phi can’t be emulated by simply choosing to investigate psychological phenomena with large effect sizes. Nor does the high replicability of content-based studies mean that psychologists should restrict their research to these kinds of studies, which Knobe says would be absurd.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florian Cova agrees, but says that the fact that some study designs tend to produce more robust findings than others should not be ignored. “If we know that certain kinds of studies are more likely to produce fragile results or false positives, we can adjust our study designs in these cases to try to minimise these risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the broadest lesson for other psychologists is the importance of basing studies on detailed theories, rather than just looking for interesting or quirky psychological phenomena. “Research in X-Phi is usually driven by a rich theory that predicts what we should expect to happen,” says Knobe. Such theory-driven research could make null results more palatable and take the pressure off needing to find some positive result to squeeze out of the data. “If we run a study in which the predicted effect doesn’t occur, that null result is still a publishable finding because it speaks to whether the theory is true or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/AYAHUASCA-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any of the 300 million individuals worldwide suffering from depression, a fast-acting, effective treatment can mean the difference between life and death. Yet despite the growing number of pharmaceutical agents advertising relief from sadness, replaced by joy and contentment, their efficacy is often staggeringly slow and poor. In contrast to the promise of immediate happiness, many drugs can leave patients numb, lethargic, fighting unpleasant side-effects, and sometimes even more deeply depressed. A likely reason for the failure of many past anti-depressants is our still incomplete understanding of the neurobiological bases for this debilitating disease. This knowledge gap precludes efforts to ease depression through chemical means. Hence, the search continues for a rapid-acting, reliable therapy. Naturally available treatment options that offer little commercial incentive have remained overlooked by pharmaceutical research. However, mounting research suggests that nature may have provided an effective means to relieve depressive symptoms, in the form of a ceremonial psychedelic brew that’s been appreciated for centuries for its mind-altering and mood-enhancing properties. After early reports that ayahuasca may be a viable alternative to the countless failed pharmaceutical therapies, a team of Brazilian researchers put it to rigorous testing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/rapid-antidepressant-effects-of-the-psychedelic-ayahuasca-in-treatmentresistant-depression-a-randomized-placebocontrolled-trial/E67A8A4BBE4F5F14DE8552DB9A0CBC97&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;found promising anti-depressant effects&lt;/a&gt; in this age-old spiritual medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A spiritual psychedelic brew&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayahuasca is an intoxicating brew used by Amazonian cultures for spiritual and medicinal purposes. It combines psychoactive plants containing the psychedelic dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and several monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Effects often last up to six hours, and include altered consciousness, sensory changes, introspection, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, vomiting, and in some cases, intense distress. Because ayahuasca can notably evoke mystical experiences and religious revelations, it has been widely used to promote spiritual awakening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ayahuasca the anti-depressant &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayahuasca has previously been found to attenuate depression severity, but until now, its therapeutic potential had not been rigorously studied in a clinical trial. In their recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Dr. Fernanda Palhano-Fontes, of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, and colleagues tested the drug in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression. On average, these individuals were moderately to severely depressed and had tried nearly four anti-depressants without success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants consumed a single dose of either ayahuasca or placebo, after which they sat quietly under supervision while the drug took effect. Depression was assessed using two depression scales before the ayahuasca session and one, two and seven days after. Compared to patients who drank placebo, those who ingested the active brew reported fewer depressive symptoms as soon as a day later, with an even stronger reduction a week later (see Figure). By the end of the week, more patients in the ayahuasca group (64%) than the placebo group (27%) responded positively to the treatment. Although remission rates for the ayahuasca group (36%) were on average higher than placebo (7%), this difference was not significant, perhaps due to an unusually high placebo effect. The improvements in mood were not without unpleasant side-effects, notably nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19602&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/Ayahuasca_depression.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-19602&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/Ayahuasca_depression-300x199.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Depression ratings are lower for ayahuasca than placebo one to seven days after intake.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The depressed brain on psychedelics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trial was an important step towards validating ayahuasca as an anti-depressant, a treatment option implicated by only a handful of prior studies. Others found that ayahuasca elicits &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25806551&quot;&gt;anti-depressant effects&lt;/a&gt; up to three weeks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650973&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;alters brain blood flow&lt;/a&gt;, but these studies were small and not placebo-controlled, the gold-standard for clinical testing. These mood-regulating benefits may not be limited to ayahuasca, as other psychedelics have similarly demonstrated therapeutic efficacy. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036616300657&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; reported that psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in hallucinogenic mushrooms, alleviated depressive symptoms a week to three months later, though this trial was not placebo-controlled. Several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16894061&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; have demonstrated that the psychedelic anesthetic ketamine reduces depression symptoms as soon as two hours and up to one week later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides offering hope for fighting depression, the rapid and robust benefits observed from ayahuasca provide valuable insight into the still mysterious neurobiological genesis of depression. To understand the mood-stabilizing powers of ayahuasca, we can look to its array of constituent chemicals. The pool of MAOIs in ayahuasca prevent the degradation of monoamines, a class of neurotransmitters implicated in depression that includes serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. The “monoamine hypothesis” of depression–which posits that monoamine deficits play a causal role–is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10775017&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;considered inadequate&lt;/a&gt; to fully explain the pathogenesis of depression. However, the benefits of ayahuasca support the theory that rebalancing monoamine neurotransmission can at least partly help to combat depression. Moreover, DMT is a serotonin agonist, meaning that it activates the brain’s serotonin receptors. However, existing drugs that act as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., Prozac, Paxil or Zoloft) also increase serotonergic activity through different means, but have relatively limited efficacy. By preventing the breakdown of several monoamines through its MAOI activity, rather than targeting a particular neurotransmitter that &lt;em&gt;may or may not&lt;/em&gt; be deficient in the individual patient, ayahuasca may offer a more generalizable therapy than conventional serotonergic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These effects are likely augmented by DMT’s activation of sigma-1 receptors, which regulate calcium signaling and have been implicated in depression, among other psychiatric conditions. MAOIs and sigma-1 receptors also promote neurogenesis and increase brain growth factors, which may further help to regulate mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The road to prescription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is ayahuasca the miracle drug we’ve long been awaiting to combat depression? Despite the promising evidence supporting its therapeutic potential, many outstanding questions need to be addressed before the psychedelic is prescribed in a clinical setting. The drug’s anti-depressant effects are fast-acting, but further research is needed to determine the duration of these effects and the optimal dosing regimen. Regular supervised, mind-altering trips that consume several hours may be impractical if frequent dosing is required. An equally pressing question is whether the side effects would preclude regular use and patient compliance. Though its non-addictive profile and absence of lasting changes to cognition or personality make ayahuasca an appealing option, the vomiting and hallucinations that often accompany the ayahuasca experience could be deal-breakers for patients desiring a less invasive therapy. Because psychedelic trips can sometimes be accompanied by negative experiences, including sensory or cognitive distortions, additional research is warranted to better characterize their neurobiological properties. Thus, it may be some time before the carefree laughter of an ayahuasca-user infiltrates the mass of TV drug advertisements. But at the very least, ongoing research into its antidepressant properties will bring us closer to understanding how our brain chemistry supports a healthy emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Tomasz Witkowski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could say without exaggeration that the discovery of a means of achieving full control over oneself is something of a “holy grail” for psychology. There is nothing to indicate that we are getting any closer to finding one, but recent decades have brought us a growing number of discoveries that at least partially allow us to enhance self-control mechanisms. One of them is the light which has been shed on the importance of rituals in boosting self-control. Now in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-22169-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, Allen Ding Tian and his collaborators have examined whether enacting rituals (defined as “a fixed episodic sequence of actions characterised by rigidity and repetition”) can enhance subjective feelings of self-discipline, such that rituals can be harnessed to improve behavioural self-control.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34223&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers planned and carried out six interesting experiments. For the first they recruited 93 undergraduate women at a gym who had a goal of losing weight. All participants received the same instructions to try to reduce their calorie intake over a 5-day period, but half were told to be “mindful” about their food consumption, whereas the other half were taught a three-step pre-eating ritual to remind them to reduce calorie intake. Before every meal they had to cut their food into pieces before consuming it. Next, they rearranged the pieces so that they were perfectly symmetric on their plates, and finally they had to press their eating utensils against the top of their food three times.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that rituals really can boost self-control. Participants who enacted a pre-eating ritual reported significantly lower calorie consumption than those who attempted to be mindful about what they ate.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers decided to replicate this study in a laboratory and find out if any random gestures would have the same beneficial effect as repeated rituals. The participants learned they would be completing a taste test of carrots and chocolate. They received four bags from the experimenter: three contained a baby carrot, one a chocolate truffle. First, they had to eat two carrots, while preceding each act of eating with either: the exact same set of ritual movements (involving knocking the table with their knuckles, closing their eyes and counting, among other things); a set of random gestures that were similar to the ritual movements but different each time (so they didn’t resemble a ritualised script); or no behaviour. Next, the participants could choose whether to eat the remaining carrot or the truffle. Participants who had enacted a ritual before eating the first two carrots tended to make the healthier choice compared with individuals in the other groups.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two further experiments involved participants either twice enacting a ritualised set of movements (though they were not labelled as such); performing one set of random gestures; or doing nothing (control group). Then they made a choice between a Snickers bar or a healthy Odwalla bar. Again, the ritual group showed greater self-control and this seemed to be driven by the way that rituals boosted their feelings of self-discipline (as measured by their agreement with statements like “I felt mentally strong when making this decision”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fourth experiment assessed the effect of rituals in another self-control context—prosocial decision-making. Participants were asked to imagine that they had been invited to a friend’s party that would be a lot of fun. They were then informed that they had received an unexpected email from an affiliated charity organisation requesting their attendance that same evening at a public fundraiser. They must decide which event to go to, but before taking the decision, one group of the participants twice performed a series of ritual movements, while other groups either engaged in a one-off series of random gestures, or they took their decision immediately. The link between performing rituals and greater self-discipline was confirmed again with the ritual group showing a greater preference for the charity fundraiser.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final experiment in the series demonstrated that rituals only affect decision making when a self-control conflict is involved (such as choosing between a fundraiser and party), not when choosing between two options where self-control is not an issue (such as choosing between two fun parties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, unlike cultural rituals, all of the rituals used in the experiments were devoid of meaning. Incorporated into various spheres of our lives, cultural rituals sometimes contribute to improving self-discipline, but there are also others which induce us to abandon self-control; these include rituals surrounding the shared consumption of celebratory meals, during which excessive self-discipline can even be taken as rudeness.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the presented studies are quite promising for anyone who would like to boost their self-control, but the authors also demonstrate how many aspects of rituals remain unexplored. One of the more interesting questions that researchers may engage concerns the potential difference in increase in self-discipline with rituals created by individuals for their own purposes, and those adopted from or even imposed by the surrounding environment. Also, does the effectiveness of a ritual depend on the amount of effort put into it? Do rituals repeated often and without requiring attention also enhance self-control? All this remains to be explored by future research.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-22169-001&quot;&gt;Enacting rituals to improve self-control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 As Retraction Watch readers may recall, the UK’s House of Commons Science and Technology Committee has been holding an inquiry into scientific misconduct for well over a year. During that inquiry, we submitted written evidence including some statistics about how the UK’s retraction rate compared to other countries, and our Ivan Oransky gave oral testimony … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/07/10/uk-house-of-commons-committee-wants-to-make-sure-university-investigations-into-research-misconduct-are-handled-appropriately/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;UK House of Commons committee wants to make sure “university investigations into research misconduct are handled appropriately”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

					&lt;div class=&quot;elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of new drugs to treat and cure human diseases is one of the noblest things in our civilization. However, 6 out of 10 drugs fail during the clinical trials, making the lengthy and expensive R&amp;amp;D process a proverbial double-edged sword. High rates of failure are often attributed to the poor predictability of 2D cell cultures and animal models that are used to test drugs during the preclinical stage. The unreliability of these models is why researchers are turning to “mini organs” in a dish, popularly known as organoids, to better understand the effects of experimental drugs on human organs. Organoids are miniaturized 3D replicas of human organs that are created by culturing stem cells or progenitor cells in a medium simulating extracellular matrix (ECM) properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Organoids have numerous impactful applications, but their applicability in disease modeling is especially noteworthy. They can be used to recapitulate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;human pathophysiology&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, providing a golden opportunity to study and treat human diseases in a 3D environment. Organoids for all major organs have already been produced. For example, gastrointestinal organoid tissues, liver-on-a-chip models, and lung-on-a-chip models are made available by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/ocello&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;OcellO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/braingineering-technologies&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Braingineering Technologies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/alveolix-bern&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;AlveoliX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This organoid technology has the potential to transform the field of precision medicine. The day when a scientist will be able to completely diagnose and cure people using their simulated forms in vitro does not seem so far away. Science Exchange believes this technology can do a world of good for R&amp;amp;D, which is why we have established an exhaustive network of qualified providers to make organoid products and services readily available.

 In April 2015, two high-profile chemistry bloggers — and their commenters — raised questions about a paper that had been published in PLOS ONE some 18 months earlier. More than three years later, the journal has now retracted the paper, with a notice that echoes the 2015 blog posts. So what took so long? PLOS … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/07/10/three-years-after-questions-surfaced-plos-one-retracts-paper-about-potential-antibiotic/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Three years after questions surfaced, PLOS ONE retracts paper about potential antibiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;Over three months ago (in March) the Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU) published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/news-items/nieuwsbericht/393-springer-nature-and-vsnu-renew-agreement-on-open-access-publishing.html&quot;&gt;very brief news item&lt;/a&gt; announcing that it had reached agreement with Springer Nature on a new OA Big Deal. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;Curious as to the details of the agreement, I invited VSNU to answer some questions, both about the Springer Nature deal and VSNU’s f&lt;a href=&quot;https://vsnu.nl/en_GB/news-items/nieuwsbericht/394-no-agreement-with-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-publishing%C2%A0.html&quot;&gt;ailure to reach agreement &lt;/a&gt;with the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), concerning which another short news item had been published at the same time. VSNU’s Spokesperson and Advisor Public Affairs Bart Pierik agree to answer my questions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;When I sent my list of questions to him, however, Pierik appeared to change his mind. “Considering the fact that we are finalising some more deals with publishers at this moment (we just published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/news-items/nieuwsbericht/396-oxford-university-press-and-vsnu-reach-agreement-on-100-open-access-deal.html&quot;&gt;good news about Oxford University Press&lt;/a&gt;) my proposal is that we would be glad to make one Q&amp;amp;A in April about all of these deals,” he emailed me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I was disappointed but decided instead to write something &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-open-access-big-deal-back-to-future.html&quot;&gt;more wide-ranging&lt;/a&gt; about the growing number of OA Big Deals we can see being agreed between legacy publishers and the research community and to mention VSNU in that larger piece.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I concluded that article by again inviting VSNU to answer my questions, adding, “By doing so they can help shine a light on this somewhat crepuscular corner of scholarly communication and demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;affordability&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;transparency&lt;/i&gt; are just as important as &lt;i&gt;accessibility&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;April came and went, and I assumed my questions had fallen into a black hole somewhere never to be seen again. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;To my surprise, however, this morning I received an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/wezenbeek/&quot;&gt;Wilma Van Wezenbeek&lt;/a&gt;, Programme Manager Open Access at VSNU.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;Not only did Van Wezenbeek attach answers to my questions but she informed me that VSNU has now published the contracts it has signed with both Springer Nature and Taylor &amp;amp; Francis (although Springer Nature has not permitted VSNU to disclose their general terms and conditions).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;

margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;The only other comment I would make at this stage is that it seems to me that if OA advocates and the wider research community want to see greater transparency over the rising number of OA Big Deals that universities, consortia and funding agencies are now signing with publishers on their behalf they are going to have to push hard. And they are going to have to keep pushing. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Richard Poynder,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has been a while that you sent Bart Pierik a list of questions to be answered by us.

For us, it includes an important milestone year: 2020.

Happily, OUP was able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/news-items/nieuwsbericht/396-oxford-university-press-and-vsnu-reach-agreement-on-100-open-access-deal.html&quot;&gt;present an acceptable offer&lt;/a&gt; a year after the previous contract had ended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Why has VSNU published so little information about the deal? At a Couperin event in January VSNU president, Koen Becking &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webcast.in2p3.fr/video/session-question-un-modele-economique-avec-les-editeurs&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that the take-home point of the meeting for him was that VSNU and other negotiators need to communicate with the research community much better over what they are doing and why. Does that not imply a far greater amount of information should have been released with the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/news-items/nieuwsbericht/393-springer-nature-and-vsnu-renew-agreement-on-open-access-publishing.html#.WqaMjisE-4Y.twitter&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the Springer Nature deal, and with the announcement that the RSC deal has failed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;VSNU:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; As happened in the past, we try to share information whenever and wherever we can, and we will continue to do so. The moment that we have reached mutual ground, it does not mean that every detail of the contract has been settled. It took us longer than we anticipated, and we are happy that we can share some more information with you now.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Larger issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraph&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: The VSNU announcement says: “the proportion of Dutch articles published open access in Springer Nature journals has risen from 34% in 2014 to 84% in 2017.” What does that mean? 84% of what: of Dutch output? Of the output of participating institutions? These are Springer figures I believe. Has VSNU done its own calculations?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;VSNU: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The figure means that 84% of the output by Dutch eligible authors have published his or her article OA at Springer Nature. In the author’s submission process the default option to publish is under a Creative Commons license. The VSNU receives monthly reports from Springer; in which these figures are shared. More information on the numbers of articles published open access at Dutch universities is available on &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openaccess.nl/en/node/675&quot;&gt;openaccess.nl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraph&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: At the Couperin &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webcast.in2p3.fr/video/session-question-un-modele-economique-avec-les-editeurs&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ralf Schimmer (Max-Planck Society) and Koen Becking (VSNU) said that these kind of OA Big Deals are simply not sustainable on a country-by-country basis. In other words, countries need to coordinate their strategy. But history suggests that this is very unlikely does it not, even within the EU? Science Business &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencebusiness.net/news/77453/Few-countries-ready-to-adopt-gold-standard-open-access-to-scientific-journals&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2016 that only five EU countries want to abandon the traditional journal subscription model and move to open access publication, and most EU countries prefer green OA. How then can these deals achieve their objective, or reduce costs in the way that Schimmer and Becking predicted at Couperin?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;VSNU:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oa2020.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt;OA2020 initiative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is growing, but you are right, we need more countries to follow us. This is something we also mention in our &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vsnu.nl/Roadmap-open-access-2018-2020-English/the-road-to-2020.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt;roadmap open access 2018-2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraph&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Meanwhile, we see funders moving towards building their own publisher platforms (mainly using the F1000 platform). Might that not be a better approach?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;VSNU:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Joining forces is an important condition to change the publishing landscape. For this reason, VSNU aligns with amongst others the Dutch funding organisation NWO and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.knaw.nl/en/homepage&quot;&gt;Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences KNAW&lt;/a&gt; at the national level, and at international level (e.g. with EUA). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we mentioned in our open access roadmap, we would like to see the research(er) to be more in control.  Creating a publication platform is one of the actions to change the way of producing and disseminating knowledge in order to reach the goal of making research output publicly available without delay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraph&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Many predict that these kinds of OA Big Deal contracts will lock legacy publishers into the new OA environment, lock in unsustainable prices, and threaten the continued existence of smaller publishers and pure OA publishers. How can you allay the concerns of those who worry about this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;VSNU:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; These are real concerns. VSNU strives for changing the scholarly output system, not to push researchers into the hands of some publishers that impose their rules and regulations. Therefore, other actions are needed, such as a change in the rewarding and recognition policies underlying researchers’ career paths and funding policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For smaller or pure OA publishers the VSNU takes into account what reasonable steps can be taken towards open access, as is mentioned in our open access roadmap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: What happens if an organisation like VSNU agrees one of these OA Big Deals with a large legacy publisher and then when it comes up for renewal cannot agree on pricing for the new one. Much has been made of the fact that researchers cannot get access to journal articles if a subscription Big Deal is not renewed, but what happens if an OA Big Deal fails? Researchers will presumably struggle to pay to publish their papers and so are more vulnerable? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;VSNU:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The preferred road to open access for the VSNU is the gold route. In case this seems to be not feasible in the end, there are alternatives of green open access or delayed open access making use of Dutch legislation (the “Taverne” amendment, see again our roadmap open access). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: It turns out that most open-access articles do not have a license attached to them. This has led Jon Brock to &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/bronze-open-access-supersedes-green-and-gold&quot;&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that publishers can deny access to the majority of open-access articles at their discretion. What if anything is VSNU doing to avoid that possibility in the deals it is signing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;VSNU:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; In the contracts, the VSNU negotiates the CC-BY license is seen by VSNU as the preferred default to prevent copyright issues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Fig-3-Bale-monkey-at-Kokosa-forest-fragment-FF-Photo_Addisu-Mekonnen-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bale monkey (&lt;em&gt;Chlorocebus djamdjamensis&lt;/em&gt;) is an tree-dwelling, rare primate species restricted to a small geographic range – less than 12,500 square kilometres – in the southern Ethiopian Highlands. Bale monkeys in intact forest habitats are bamboo specialist herbivores that rely on a single species of highland bamboo (&lt;em&gt;Arundinaria alpina&lt;/em&gt;) accounting for 77-81% of their annual diet, which is mostly young leaves and shoots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habitat alteration and climate change are the major threats to biodiversity conservation, particularly for those specialist, rare species inhabiting small geographic ranges. These species are assumed to be less flexible at adapting to a changing environment than generalist species. Similar to other bamboo specialist mammals, such as giant pandas and bamboo lemurs, Bale monkeys are currently at high risk of extinction because of habitat alteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bale monkeys are classified as a Vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with a total population size of less than 10,000 individuals and a general trend of population decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10363&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10363 size-large&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Fig-1-Three-Chlorocebus-species-found-in-Ethiopia-A-Bale-monkey-B-grivet-monkey-and-C-vervet-monkey-1024x338.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Three Chlorocebus species found in Ethiopia. A. Bale monkey. B. Grivet monkey. C. Vervet monkey.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Bale monkeys, Ethiopia harbours two other &lt;em&gt;Chlorocebus&lt;/em&gt; species: the vervet monkey (&lt;em&gt;C. pygerythrus&lt;/em&gt;) and the grivet monkey (&lt;em&gt;C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; aethiops&lt;/em&gt;). These two species are widely distributed in Africa, semi-terrestrial ecological generalists, inhabiting a variety of habitats and consuming a diverse diet of plant species and invertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that understanding the population genetic structure of endangered species is essential to designing successful science-based management plans to ensure long-term survival. Thus, we aimed to investigate the genetic diversity and phylogeography of Bale monkey populations inhabiting continuous forest and forest fragments using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collected a total of 119 Bale monkey faecal samples from May to December 2013 at three localities in continuous forest and nine localities in fragmented forests. We extracted, amplified and analysed mtDNA from these samples. We also included a total of 12 samples from other green monkeys in Ethiopia for the purpose of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep genetic differentiation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very surprising to find a strong and deep genetic differentiation between the Bale monkey populations inhabiting continuous forest and those inhabiting fragmented forests dating back 2.8 million years and corresponding to their geographic structuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is strong and deep genetic differentiation between the Bale monkey populations inhabiting continuous forest and those inhabiting fragmented forests dating back 2.8 million years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, Bale monkeys in fragmented forests are more closely related to their sister species (vervets  and grivets) than their conspecifics in continuous forest, suggesting hybridization between Bale monkeys in forest fragments with vervets and grivets found in the surrounding region associated with habitat alteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bale monkeys inhabiting intact bamboo forests of the Bale Mountains form monophyletic group, suggesting they are the source population of Bale monkeys and are not likely to be hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bale monkey populations in continuous forest and forest fragments not only differ in their genetics but also in their ecology, morphology and gut microbiota. These differences further support the hypothesis that gene flow has already altered the gene pool of Bale monkey population in fragmented forests, making these monkeys ecologically flexible and more similar to other &lt;em&gt;Chlorocebus &lt;/em&gt;species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10369&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-10369&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Fig-2-Bale-monkey-at-Odobullu-continuous-forest-CF-of-the-Bale-Mountains_Photo_Addisu-Mekonnen-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A Bale monkey in the Odobullu (continuous) forest of the Bale Mountains&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of Bale monkeys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of a clear and deep genetic structuring between Bale monkey populations in continuous forest and forest fragments, we therefore propose two separate management units when implementing conservation strategies for Bale monkeys. For continuous forest Bale monkeys, we recommend improved protection of their intact bamboo forest habitat. For the fragmented forest population, we recommend connecting forest fragments to increase gene flow between isolated groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results of this study increase our general understanding of how habitat fragmentation and hybridization together have shaped the genetic structure of the rare, range-restricted and bamboo-specialist Bale monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do acknowledge, however, that our genetic analysis should be interpreted with caution because we used a single and maternally inherited mtDNA locus that tells us only about the maternal history. Further research focusing on bi-parentally and paternally inherited genetic markers, as well as morphological and ecological studies is needed to understand the evolutionary history of this unusual species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of my role at the Digest involves sifting through journals looking for research worth covering, and I’ve sensed that modern social psychology generates plenty of studies based on questionnaire data, but far fewer that investigate the kind of tangible behavioural outcomes illuminated by the field’s classics, from Asch’s conformity experiments to Milgram’s research on obedience to authority. A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://spb.psychopen.eu/articles.php?id=25025&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Social Psychological Bulletin &lt;/i&gt;examines this apparent change systematically. Based on his findings, Dariusz Doliński at the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Poland asks the bleak question: is psychology still a science of behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34199&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doliński is following in the footsteps of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00051.x&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published over a decade ago, which looked at the January 2006 contents of what Doliński describes as social psychology’s “flagship” publication, the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/psp/&quot;&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, published by the American Psychological Association. Roy Baumeister and colleagues sought research that involved behavioural outcomes more active than “finger movements” – typing on a computer, clicking a mouse or filling in a survey by hand. They found active behavioural outcomes were measured by only 12 per cent of studies published in the journal that month, compared to an estimated 80 per cent in the same journal 30 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this a blip, or a trend? Doliński looked at six issues of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt; published in the second half of 2017. He found that from 45 empirical articles, only four went beyond participants answering questions or filling in surveys; overall, only 6 per cent of the analysed studies measured actual behaviour.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when behaviour was studied, it was frequently nothing more than another case of finger movement. One study measured whether people would over-report their achievements on an experimental task; another looked at endurance in solving cognitive tasks; a third involved the “prisoner’s dilemma”, a financial game that doesn’t require any overt behaviour as such. Only one study looked at a truly active behaviour – the social interactions of pre-school children. Doliński likely had his tongue only partly in cheek when wondering whether this approach would still have been used if pre-school children were comfortable filling in questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s behind this anti-behavioural turn? Some of it is connected to the cognitive revolution: the recognition in psychological science that internal processes like memory, learning and attention are crucial to understanding behaviour. This has been immensely useful and worth celebrating, but it doesn’t exclude studying a diversity of behaviours as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doliński raises a few other obvious pressures that are harder to celebrate. Studying behaviours is more difficult, and often more costly and expensive, than studying verbal declarations. Behaviours are also harder to verify (was that spontaneous gesture friendly or unfriendly?) and to record. It may also be harder to convince ethics boards to approve a behavioural study than another survey study. In addition, observed behaviour is often binary and one-shot per participant. You offer help to cross a street; you return the found item; you go to vote; you sign the petition,… or you don’t. Not only does this often call for larger sample sizes, it limits how you can analyse the data, making it harder to produce persuasive models of pathways between mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a concrete example of how the behavioural instinct has been blunted, Doliński points to a piece of research on physical intimacy (from the journal issues he reviewed) that did make the effort to go into the field. Experimenters visited a clinic providing flu shots, but did they observe how waiting patients interacted, or how closely they approached the receptionist or stood in line? No: they simply asked people more questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because declarations of behavioural intentions do not always translate to behaviours. For instance, lottery winners rarely donate their cash to charity, even though more than a quarter of survey respondents claim they would give substantially. Also, while the very robust “bystander effect” shows that people are less likely to act to counter a transgressive act when others are present, people asked to describe their hypothetical actions believe they would be as likely to act whether several other people are also present or not. Similarly, recent work canvassing opinions on the Milgram experiment &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01632&quot;&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that most people believe they would not have carried out the experimenters’ orders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/05/new-milgram-replication-finds-90-per-cent-of-polish-participants-willing-to-deliver-highest-shock/&quot;&gt;even though most people do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doliński worries that social psychologists doing the important work of field studies, and those studying behaviour more generally, are being shut out of the best journals in their field. Social psychology is already going through a process of reform as it responds to concerns about research quality. Perhaps it should take this opportunity to also consider adjusting its incentive systems to make more of research that does the best it can to see how psychological manipulations impact the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://spb.psychopen.eu/articles.php?id=25025&quot;&gt;Is Psychology Still a Science of Behaviour?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Papers will speak to the epidemic and the strategies being developed to address it. Due to their structural similarity, this special issue uses the umbrella term “opioids” to also include opiates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public health crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North America and Europe are currently grappling with a public health crisis associated with widespread access to prescription opioid analgesics, enhanced purity of heroin, the introduction of potent fentanyl compounds, and a rising tide of opioid overdose fatalities. In the United States, prescriptions for hydrocodone and oxycodone exploded beginning in the late 1990s. Now, more than 2 million individuals in the United States have an opioid use disorder. Most of these individuals were introduced to opioids via a prescription for an opioid analgesic (either for themselves or another party).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;more than 2 million individuals in the United States have an opioid use disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescription drug monitoring programs have resulted in a drop in the prescription of opioid analgesics and patients dependent on opioids feel compelled to shift to the use of illicit heroin or a synthetic opioid. As a result, overdoses are on the rise and overdose fatalities exceeded 63,000 in 2016. Fentanyl derivatives now make a major contribution to the current opioid crisis, and over a short period of time they have become the substances most associated with overdose mortality. Drug overdose deaths remain high in Europe, and according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, opioids are implicated in the majority of cases. These deaths have become the face of the opioid epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addiction treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that treatment works. A recent study found that treatment of opioid use disorder with either methadone or buprenorphine following a nonfatal opioid overdose is associated with significant reductions in opioid related mortality. A barrier to positive long term outcomes, however, is the lack of access and retention in treatment. Exciting advances are being made to reformulate some of the traditional opioid agonist therapy (i.e., methadone and buprenorphine) to improve patient adherence to treatment. An opioid antagonist therapy (i.e., extended-release naltrexone) provides an alternative to agonist therapy. Psychosocial therapy combined with either agonist or antagonist medication facilitates healthier lives and lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naloxone distribution and opioid overdose education have saved many lives. Programs such as Get Naloxone Now (http://www.getnaloxonenow.org) are effectively training care providers and community members on how to save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for papers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addiction health services research is on the front lines in the fight to address the opioid epidemic. The papers in this special issue illustrate applications of these tools in North American and Europe. Manuscripts submitted before January 30, 2019 will be reviewed for inclusion in the issue. See the call for papers announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many animals, including sea lions and dogs, can accurately predict the size and strength of a potential adversary in part by listening to their vocalisations – such as the ferocity and depth of their barks or growls. People weren’t thought to be much good at doing something similar. But in previous studies, volunteers were asked to judge the &lt;i&gt;absolute&lt;/i&gt; height and strength of another person, based on the sound of an aggressively-spoken sentence or a ‘roar’. Now in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004218300579&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;iScience&lt;/i&gt;, when participants were instead instructed to listen to recordings and judge how much stronger, or weaker, taller or shorter the vocaliser was, &lt;i&gt;compared with themselves&lt;/i&gt;, they could do this with a high degree of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers, led by David Reby at the University of Sussex, point out, this is potentially far more practically useful than being able to discern someone else’s absolute height or strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34192&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recorded 30 male and 31 female drama or acting students at the University of Sussex, who were instructed to imagine themselves in a battle or war scenario, about to charge and attack, and to utter “That’s enough, I’m coming for you!”, followed by a “non-verbal vocalisation” expressing the same motivation (these usually sounded like roars). The researchers then measured each student’s height and also their flexed bicep circumference and handgrip strength, which were used to produce a single strength score for each person.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of listeners rated relative strength. These were 45 men and women recruited from Tromso (and surrounding rural towns) in Norway (all were fluent English speakers), and from the University of Sussex. They also had their own handgrip strength and flexed bicep circumference measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate group of 56 people from the US rated the vocalisers’ relative height, and self-reported their own heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These listeners rated all the vocalisers on a 101 point scale, from -50 (much weaker / shorter) to +50 (much stronger / taller), with the slider’s default position set to 0 (“same as you”). &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that overall both men and women were fairly good at identifying whether the vocalisers were relatively stronger/weaker and taller/shorter than themselves. For example, when judging roars – which, for male (but not female) vocalisers increased perceived strength more than the aggressive sentence – male listeners correctly rated vocalisers who were substantially stronger than they were as being stronger 88 per cent of the time (and never ranked such vocalisers as being weaker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But analysis of the finely-scaled judgements made using the 101-point sliding scale also revealed some biases. There was a general tendency for women to over-estimate male vocalisers’ relative strength, and men to under-estimate women’s relative strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say this fits with previous findings of a general tendency for women to underestimate, and men to over-estimate their abilities. However, given that men are, on average, stronger than women, from an evolutionary perspective, it may be safer for a woman to err on the side of caution, and assume that the (invisible) owner of a male voice is significantly stronger, as she’ll be right more often than not.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, as has been demonstrated with other mammals, “both male and female listeners can use available formidability cues conveyed in aggressive speech and roars to make ecologically relevant judgements about speakers with a high degree of accuracy,” the researchers conclude.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004218300579&quot;&gt;Human Listeners Can Accurately Judge Strength and Height Relative to Self from Aggressive Roars and Speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/all-natural-1866415_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10255&quot; style=&quot;width: 227px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-10255&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Wild-potato-Solanum-venturi-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;217&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Wild potato&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied two different races of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora_infestans&quot;&gt;Irish potato famine pathogen&lt;/a&gt;, and we discovered that the difference invirulence between these races could not be ascribed to a genetic difference but rather to a difference in the expression of the underlying virulence gene. This adds to our knowledge of how this important scourge on world agriculture evolves to evade plant immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this work important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markgijzen/statuses/841336667789225984&quot;&gt;Mark Gijzen tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “is this a rare and unusual curiosity or another example of a widespread biological phenomenon?” Indeed, there are few other examples in related plant pathogens, including the soybean root rot pathogen that Mark studies. This finding has far reaching implications. It indicates that these pathogens can evolve even more rapidly than anticipated thus counteracting the efforts of plant breeders to deploy disease resistant crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are potato varieties resistant to the pathogen available?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are. But there are several examples of potato cultivars that were initially resistant to late blight when farmers started to grow them, but succumbed to the disease a few years later. The ability to switch on and off virulence genes such as we found in this research may partly explain why the pathogen is so effective at overcoming the plants defense barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are potato varieties initially resistant to Phytophthora infestans that have succumbed to late blight a few years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is currently done to control the disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susceptible potato cultivars must be protected by repeated applications of fungicides. If left unchecked, the disease will destroy the leaves and stems in a matter of days as in the pictured trial plot of potato varieties in the highlands of Peru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is chemical protection the only way to control late blight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, there are wild relatives of the cultivated potato and many of them can withstand the disease (see image of potato variety field trial). Breeders identify the genes in these plants and introduce them to cultivated potato through crosses or genetic transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10256&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10256&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/field-trial-Peru2-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A field trial in Peru&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you put this project together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied an Andean lineage of the Irish potato famine pathogen known as EC-1 so the project had an international flavor from day one. Ours was a wide reaching multinational collaboration bringing together scientists based in the UK, Japan, Netherlands, USA, Philippines, and Peru. It’s how science often goes on these days. Experts from all over the world team up to solve problems, make new discoveries and advance our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything you would have done differently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA sequencing technology develops so fast that by the time the paper gets published you wish you could apply a different method. It also takes more time to analyze the data, write up the paper etc. than to generate the sequence data. This can be frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/11/116012&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;posted the paper in bioRxiv before submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not? Posting the article on bioRxiv enabled us to share our findings with our colleagues and hear about it from the community &lt;a href=&quot;http://asapbio.org/preprint-info/preprint-faq&quot;&gt;as soon as possible&lt;/a&gt;. The tweet by Mark Gijzen we referred to above is an example of such feedback. Posting a preprint relieves some of the delays associated with publishing. It’s a liberating feeling to finish writing up a paper and immediately share it with anyone who’s interested.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2018/07/qa-with-li-cor/"/>
		<id>http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=1664</id>
		<updated>2018-07-06T14:35:20+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gursatya/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guru Singh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, Director of Scientific Content of Science Exchange, recently spoke with Jim Wiley, Director of Marketing, Biotechnology at &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/li-cor-biosciences&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;LI-COR Biosciences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. Follow the interview below.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What should Science Exchange users know about LI-COR?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are committed to making research reproducible. To illustrate, LI-COR is the only company that has developed methods required by journals and funding agencies to ensure that the Western blot data submitter is ready to produce robust and replicable data. We are also the only company in the Western blot market to deliver training materials/courses to educate the researcher on the above methods. These are available in the new LI-COR Lambda U&lt;img alt=&quot;™&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt; learning portal. Also, our Custom Services group can provide exploratory/confirmatory Western blot services and antibody validation services, which relate to journal requirements and ensure research reproducibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Just as important, LI-COR has expertise in IRDye® products (IRDye infrared fluorescent dyes) used for surgical, therapeutic, and diagnostic applications. There are over 20 ongoing clinical trials that have propelled the use of these dyes. Unlike other life science companies, we have the products, tools, and services that can successfully help researchers take their ‘probe’ from benchtop to clinic. Custom services also include probe labeling, probe validation, and probe manufacturing (non-cGMP and cGMP).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What makes your offerings unique?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Only LI-COR has developed the full solution that includes products, tools, and services to set researchers up for success in delivering the most accurate, robust, and replicable Western blot data. Innovation was required to define and develop new protocols; there was no precise definition of how to calculate ‘replicates’ for Western blotting. LI-COR worked with the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) to create a definition (and later a protocol) that will now be enforced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are your primary proprietary technologies?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our proprietary technologies include the Odyssey® Imager, IRDye infrared dyes, and the related methods/protocols developed to match the journals’ and funding agencies’ stringent data creation/submission requirements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How is your molecular imaging superior to the chemiluminescent-based detection?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are limitations to film and visible fluorescent detection methods that make them very difficult to hit all the requirements. One example is the requirement that one must prove that their target and normalization signal are both in the same linear range of detection. This is straight-forward when using LI-COR products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell me about your global presence.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;LI-COR Biotechnology products are supported globally by a network of distributors and are used in more than 100 countries. We sell directly to the US, Canada, and 11 European countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interesting. How big is your company? (e.g., number of employees, funding status, etc.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;LI-COR has been in business for over 45 years and currently consists of 300 employees. Since LI-COR is a private company, we cannot comment on our funding status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What type of certifications does your company have? (e.g., GxP, minority-owned, women-owned, etc.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are ISO 9001:2015 certified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How is your technology different than that of your competitors?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It is not just one technology that separates LI-COR from the competition, but that we offer the complete package of products (imagers, software, and reagents), tools (protocols and educational materials), and services (training from expert scientists and customer services). These were developed to aid researchers in getting the best data possible, all in alignment with the new publisher requirements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whom do you serve? What does your current client base look like?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We serve researchers that utilize Western blots or are involved in probe development in their research in all markets including academia, the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology, and government agencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How has your partnership with Science Exchange been?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are inspired by Science Exchange’s mission to drive science forward by matching the research needs of scientists with the best solution providers. Science Exchange has been a terrific partner for introducing LI-COR to researchers who are looking for what LI-COR experts can offer through our Custom Services group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before we wrap up, do you have any final message to Science Exchange users?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Take advantage of LI-COR’s over 20 years of experience in quantitative Western blotting and infrared dye applications. Our scientific experts have developed the methods and protocols that you need to successfully create the best data possible. If you need custom services and/or manufacturing, LI-COR scientists will partner with you to deliver the best results possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Capture-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Cancer: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-018-4607-z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does hypnosis improve the quality of life for prostate cancer patients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10349&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10349 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/4193153605_e07578c81a_b-300x182.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr: Karl Birrane&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals suffering from prostate or breast cancer can experience symptoms such as emotional distress, fatigue and sleep difficulties resulting in a decrease in their quality of life. While previous studies have identified the benefits of hypnosis and other group interventions in reducing fatigue and emotional distress in breast cancer patients, a study by Grégoire &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt; sought to identify whether these types of interventions would also be beneficial to prostate cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study assessed 25 men with prostate cancer and 68 women with breast cancer before and after a self-hypnosis/self-care group intervention. The researchers then analyzed the impact this group intervention had on the patients’ quality of life, sleep difficulties and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the results of the study showed that, whilst the female breast cancer group experienced positive effects of the intervention on various symptoms including depression, anxiety and fatigue, the male prostate cancer group reported no effect. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the greater difficulties and different cancer treatments the breast cancer group experienced prior to the intervention compared to the prostate cancer group. The male prostate cancer group also reported few problems with distress, sleep or fatigue prior to the intervention, which may have contributed to the lack of reported improvement on these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Rheumatology: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41927-018-0023-x&quot;&gt;Knee osteoarthritis and patients’ beliefs&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-10350&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/arthrocalman-2384253_960_720-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by Darlow &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt;, investigates the beliefs that patients with knee osteoarthritis have the disease, as well as how these beliefs are formed and the impact they have on participating in activity, self-management and health behavior. Thirteen individuals from New Zealand with knee osteoarthritis were interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that patients were often uncertain of how to interpret their daily symptoms, and what they can do to influence the rate of decline. This resulted in patients believing that joint replacement is the only effective option available to them. Ultimately, misunderstandings about knee osteoarthritis led to a negative impact on the individuals’ participation in activity, their health behaviors and their self-management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that improving the provision of information to those with knee osteoarthritis may help guide positive health behavior and self-management decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-10351&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/white-2565766_960_720-300x228.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Metabolic syndrome consists of multiple conditions such as high blood pressure, excess fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol levels which, when combined, increases the individuals’ risk of stroke, heart disease and diabetes. Previous studies have investigated the link between differing lengths of sleep duration and various diseases such as obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published by &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, Kim et al. studied the association between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome in Koreans aged 40-69 years old. This cross-sectional study analyzed the data of over 130,000 individuals from the years 2004-2013. Sleep categories assessed were less than 6 hours, 6 to less than 8 hours, 8 to less than 10 hours and at least 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that less than 6 hours of sleep a day was associated with metabolic syndrome in men, and elevated waist circumference in men and women. More than 10 hours of sleep was associated with elevated waist circumference, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated fasting glucose in women, whereas elevated triglycerides and metabolic syndrome were associated with more than 10 hours sleep in both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10353&quot; style=&quot;width: 226px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10353 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/20764501819_133649d11c_k-216x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;216&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr: Office of Naval Research&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new BMC journals opened for submissions in June. &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; will focus on the combination of tools and methods from biology and medicine with mathematics, physical sciences and engineering with the ultimate goal of improving human health. &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; will encompass the production of, use, transformation, transportation and reuse of chemicals, biochemicals, materials and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both journals are now open for submissions, and many more journals will soon be launched to expand the scope of the BMC series beyond biology and medicine and into engineering. Both journals are open access and peer reviewed, and neither makes editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. The first articles will be published in November 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pulmonary Medicine:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-018-0672-y&quot;&gt;Earlier smoking after waking and the risk of asthma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-10354&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/cigarette-3022376_960_720-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research conducted by Arielle Selya, Sunita Thapa and Guarav Mehta investigated whether smoking within 5 minutes of waking up (an indicator of nicotine dependence) was independently associated with asthma. Outcomes of asthma assessed included lifetime asthma, past-year asthma, and having had an asthma attack in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that smoking within 5 minutes of waking up was associated with an approximately 50% increase in the likelihood of lifetime asthma and past-year asthma retrospectively. It was also associated with a 4 times increase in the likelihood of lifetime asthma. These findings may be used in order to refine the risk assessments of asthma among smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

In a paper published by &lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, Butler-Laporte &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; assess whether a score based on patient factors and MRSA colonization is able to predict the risk of MRSA infection in cases of &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bacteremia, to inform the need for empiric coverage.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that MRSA colonization surpassed all other factors to be the only reliable and independent predictor of MRSA infection. Further patient diseases or disorders were not adequate predictors of MRSA colonization. The study results indicate that a clinical approach based on a patient’s known MRSA colonization status and on local susceptibility patterns may be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

They exhibit repetitive behavior patterns, rarely sleep or interact with mates, swim continuously and have high levels or cortisol (the stress hormone) in their blood. In a paper published by &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;, Yoshizawa &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;used this species as a model to study the genetic mechanisms which underlie ASD.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the researchers do not believe the behaviors between humans and fish are at the same levels of complexity, their findings do suggest that the behaviors in both species are evolutionarily conserved. The study surveyed genes that share the same evolutionary ancestor between cavefish and humans and similarities were identified. They also surveyed evolved genes in the cavefish lineage, finding that ASD-risk genes evolved at twice the rate of other genes across the cavefish genome. The study concludes that the evolution of humans and fish share basic neural networks that generate ASD-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who’ve had an out-of-body experience (OBE) report that their conscious awareness shifted outside their physical body – often upwards, so they felt like they were floating above their own head. It’s thought that OBEs occur when the brain fails to properly integrate data from the different senses, including vision, touch, proprioception (the sense of where the limbs and other body parts are located in space) and from the vestibular system (organs in the inner ear that monitor head orientation, balance and motion).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has mostly focused on the role of vision and touch – for example by triggering the illusion of viewing one’s own body – but the vestibular system has largely been neglected. If it does play an important role we should expect that problems with the vestibular system – which often present as feelings of dizziness – lead to OBEs, but do they? &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical case studies suggested that they might. And now, published in &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669509&quot;&gt;first systematic study&lt;/a&gt; of patients referred to a neurological specialist because of dizziness has found that they can.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34162&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christophe Lopez, a neuroscientist at Aix Marseille University, and Maya Elziere, a neurologist specialising in balance disorders at the Hôpital Européen, also in Marseille, France, compared 210 patients referred to them for dizziness and vertigo (having the feeling of spinning, swaying or tilting, being off balance, or that the room is spinning) with the same number of age and gender-matched controls. They found that the patients were much more likely to report having had an OBE – 14 per cent had had at least one, compared with 5 per cent of the healthy controls. And most of these patients reported having an OBE only after their dizziness had started.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their OBE, most of the patients reported vestibular sensations – of elevation and lightness, for example. (One reported a “sensation of entering my body, like in an envelope, from the top”). The vast majority of these patients also reported having had not just one but multiple OBEs, which usually lasted for a few seconds or a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OBEs were linked mainly to dizziness caused by obvious problems with the vestibular system itself such as vestibular neuritis and Meniere’s disease (rather than being brain-based). Yet, most patients with these same vestibular problems did not develop OBEs so something else must be going on to contribute to the experience. Questionnaire results showed that scores for “depersonalisation-derealization”, depression and anxiety, were the main predictors of OBE in patients with dizziness, suggesting these psychological factors interact with the physical problem&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;of atypical signals being sent from the vestibular system to generate OBEs. In healthy controls, there was also a relationship between depersonalisation-derealization scores and reported OBEs. This isn’t a surprise: depersonalisation-derealization involves feelings of observing yourself from outside your body, or having the sense that things around you aren’t real.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anxiety was also a significant predictor – and anxiety is known to be linked to vertigo – “we suggest that anxiety and depersonalisation-derealization may combine to precipitate OBE in patients with dizziness,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as their cost-saving appeal, the rationale for large open-plan offices is that they are expected to act as a crucible for human chemistry, increasing face-to-face encounters between colleagues to the benefit of creativity and collaboration. Unfortunately it’s well-established that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/19/the-supposed-benefits-of-open-plan-offices-do-not-outweigh-the-costs/&quot;&gt;most workers don’t like them&lt;/a&gt;, such is the fundamental human need for privacy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/03/27/why-its-important-that-employers-let-staff-personalise-their-workspaces/&quot;&gt;control over one’s environment&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1753/20170239&quot;&gt;a pair of quasi-experimental field studies&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&lt;/em&gt; suggest that the supposed collaborative advantage of open-plan offices also doesn’t pass muster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34170&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan Bernstein and Stephen Turban, at Harvard Business School and Harvard University, respectively, recruited 52 employees at the global headquarters of a Fortune 500 multinational company that was about to undergo a redesign of an entire floor, stripping out the individual cubicles to create a fully open-plan workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants, whose roles included sales, technology and human resources, wore a “sociometric badge” and microphone for three weeks prior to the redesign. Then a couple of months after the office refit, they wore the badge and microphone again for another three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bluetooth-enabled electronic badges and the microphones allowed the researchers to monitor the frequency of the employees’ face-to-face interactions. The company also granted access to their servers so the researchers could look for any changes in use of email and instant messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were stark: after the shift to an open-plan office space, the participants spent 73 per cent less time in face-to-face interactions, while their use of email and instant messenger shot up by 67 per cent and 75 per cent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study involving 100 employees at another Fortune 500 company was similar but this time the researchers monitored changes to the nature of the interactions between specific pairs of colleagues before the shift to an open-plan office compared with afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 1830 interacting dyads and, of these, 643 reduced their amount of face-to-face interaction after the workspace became open-plan, compared with just 141 showing more physical interaction. Overall, face-to-face time decreased by around 70 per cent across the participating employees, on average, with email use increasing by between 22 per cent and 50 per cent (depending on the estimation method used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever sought refuge from the gold-fish bowl of an open-plan office environment by cocooning yourself with headphones, or if you’ve decided you’d rather not have that challenging conversation with a colleague in front of a large group of your peers, and opted to email them instead, then these findings will come as little surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while a great deal of research has established &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/19/the-supposed-benefits-of-open-plan-offices-do-not-outweigh-the-costs/&quot;&gt;employees’ negative feelings about open-plan offices&lt;/a&gt;, both in terms of lost privacy and adverse effects on communication, this is the first study to provide an objective measure of the impact of an open-plan space on how people interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real-life setting of this research is a major advantage but it does of course come at the expense of full experimental control and it remains a possibility that other factors, besides the office design change, may explain the results. The researchers did attempt to mitigate this possibility, such as by allowing time for the employees to settle into the new office design before resuming data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While it is possible to bring chemical substances together under specific conditions of temperature and pressure to form the desired compound, more factors seem to be at work in achieving a similar effect with humans,” the researchers said. “Until we understand those factors, we may be surprised to find a reduction in face-to-face collaboration at work even as we architect transparent, open spaces intended to increase it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1753/20170239&quot;&gt;The impact of the ‘open’ workspace on human collaboration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

by Taylor &amp;amp; Francis last September it was assumed (by me at least) that controversy had become a thing of the past for the publisher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seven months after the purchase, however, a medical technology company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://minervasurgical.com/&quot;&gt;Minerva Surgical&lt;/a&gt; took the unusual step of publishing a &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/minerva-surgical-requests-immediate-retraction-of-misleading-intl-journal-of-womens-health-publication-that-compares-novasure-to-minerva-sponsored-by-hologic-300637791.html&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; alleging that &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/I1I7CrkEYwi8nAVEQSwP-n3?domain=dovepress.com&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; published in Dove’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/W64GCqxV2vt8kO0ZYSw9okT?domain=dovepress.com&quot;&gt;International Journal of Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/W64GCqxV2vt8kO0ZYSw9okT?domain=dovepress.com&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;’&lt;/i&gt;s Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; makes “material misleading statements” about the nature of a study funded by a rival in “clear violation of the COPE guidelines.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result, Minerva said, the paper should be retracted immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;To discuss this latest incident, Dove’s background, and some of the “historical issues” the publisher has faced, Taylor &amp;amp; Francis’ Director, Medicine and Open Access, agreed to do a Q&amp;amp;A with me, which I publish below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the latest controversy Kahn says, “our investigations show that the peer review was carried out to high standards and that the journal behaved well, and the authors responses have satisfied us that the complaints are unfounded.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the historical issues, she adds, the naysayers were wrong to have doubted Dove’s probity. “We went through very detailed due diligence, carrying out an extremely thorough process, when we acquired Dove Medical Press. We were satisfied that, after some historical issues, improvements had been made to their peer review process working with the OASPA membership team … Eight months on from our acquisition, Dove are performing well in all areas, we remain confident that we got value for money, and are delighted that they are part of Taylor &amp;amp; Francis Group.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are one or two places in the Q&amp;amp;A where readers may feel there is a little repetition. If so, this is because the interview was done by email in a staged way. I have, however, not edited the text as I am keen to publish Kahn’s answers exactly as she emailed them to me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A begins …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I am wondering why Taylor &amp;amp; Francis (T&amp;amp;F) decided to buy Dove Medical Press? I have seen the short &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.taylorandfrancisgroup.com/dove-medical-press-joins-taylor-francis-group/&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; published at the time, which talks of Dove journals having Impact Factors (and of T&amp;amp;F wanting to expand in OA and medical journals) but I am also aware that the perception in the market is that (as this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/U80xCjRvnlfnGj58ot4-9e3?domain=statnews.com&quot;&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;), titles from Dove “tend to rank poorly on impact factor”. Can you say more about why T&amp;amp;F chose to buy Dove? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Open Access and Medical publishing are both strategically important areas of investment and growth for Taylor &amp;amp; Francis. So we were delighted when we were able to enter into discussions with Dove Medical Press, as they fit so well with our plans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dove Medical Press is a small and entrepreneurial company, with staff based in Auckland and Macclesfield, all of whom are committed to excellent service to authors, and high-quality peer review. They publish around 100 journals, of which 12 have impact factors ranging from 1.7 to 7 –  almost all of them placed within the top two quartiles of the Journal Citation Report. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two more titles are set to receive Impact Factors in the next release of the JCR. The vast majority of the rest of the journals are indexed in the DOAJ, PubMed and the Emerging Sources Citation Index (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mjl.clarivate.com/cgi-bin/jrnlst/jlresults.cgi?PC=EX&quot;&gt;ESCI&lt;/a&gt;). All of these indexes perform in-depth checks on the quality and integrity of the contents of journals before accepting them for indexing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We chose to buy Dove because we were impressed by the quality of their content, the quality of their peer review, their focus on author experience, and their loyal author following, with a high percentage of repeat authors. We rated it a very good business in its own right and knew that we would learn from them as we continued to develop our own open access offerings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How much did T&amp;amp;F pay for Dove?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; This wasn’t disclosed at the time of acquisition. Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://informa.com/media/press-releases-news/latest-news/informa-extends-open-access-position-and-capability-with-addition-of-dove-medical-press/&quot;&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt; released by Informa, our parent company. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Yes, I saw that, but I was hoping you could tell me anyway? Frankly, I don’t understand why this information needs to be secret, although I suppose it fits with the secrecy that has always surrounded Dove. When I interviewed Dove’s Tim Hill in 2008 he refused to tell me who the owners of Dove were and denied that (despite what some believed) there was any connection between Libertas Academica (LA) and Dove, or with him (aside from the fact that the owner of LA was his son). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, when in 2010 I &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2016/02/why-i-wont-be-doing-that-video.html&quot;&gt;emailed him&lt;/a&gt; to point out that New Zealand Companies House records that he had one time been the sole director and shareholder of LA, and had in fact  been a director of LA when he told me in 2008 that there was no connection, he responded, “Henceforth I will not be providing you with any comment or information on any subject.” In 2016, I tried to make contact with Dove directors Graeme Peterson and Kevin Toale, neither of whom responded. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Can you tell me why there has always been this kind of secrecy surrounding Dove? OA advocates argue that scholarly publishing is primarily funded by the taxpayer and so should be transparent both in process and financing. There is now also a widespread belief that there should be even greater transparency with regard to medical research, and those who publish it, not least because it is felt that pay-to-publish OA has made it easier for pharmaceutical and medical device companies to use scholarly papers as marketing tools. Do you agree that there are dangers here and that greater transparency is essential? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I do believe that there should be transparency in all scholarly publishing, both in traditional subscription and open access publishing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/&quot;&gt;COPE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/&quot;&gt;OASPA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wame.org/&quot;&gt;WAME&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doaj.org/&quot;&gt;DOAJ&lt;/a&gt; have collaborated to identify &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/principles-transparency-and-best-practice-scholarly-publishing&quot;&gt;Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, and these principles form part of the criteria on which membership applications to those organizations are evaluated. All Dove journals are &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2JeQrsr&quot;&gt;included in the DOAJ&lt;/a&gt; and have “&lt;a href=&quot;https://doaj.org/faq#thetick&quot;&gt;the tick&lt;/a&gt;”, which means they have met the high level of compliance to these criteria. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All Dove journals are also members of COPE and have met their membership criteria also.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t think that there has been secrecy around Dove Medical Press. Information about the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04967656&quot;&gt;has been available from Companies House&lt;/a&gt; since they came into existence in 2003. Nothing in our due diligence suggested anything to the contrary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tim Hill (from Dove) is Tom Hill’s father, and he may have helped his son establish Libertas Academica in the first instance. However, Tim Hill was not involved in the direction or any of the operations of Libertas Academica. No current Dove staff have ever worked with or as part of Libertas Academica, nor do the two companies share any operations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Dove is registered in the UK but, as I understand it, the company actually operates out of New Zealand.

Graeme Peterson has never been the Managing Director of Dove. When he became a Director of Dove, he was (and still is) Managing Director of Prime Global (previously Prime Medica). The Companies House listing clearly shows that he was Company Secretary and Director of Dove from 2004 to 2017. His listing shows his occupation as Managing Director, but this was of Prime Global not of Dove.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You talk of three founders of Dove. When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2008/11/open-access-interviews-dove-medical.html&quot;&gt;spoke to&lt;/a&gt; Tim Hill in 2008, he told me the company was founded by “a group of former publishing executives, mostly from ADIS International” and that it was owned by “six private individuals”. Companies House records show there were four directors of the company – Graeme Peterson, Philip Smith, Kevin Toale and John Stolz. The shareholders included Peterson, Smith, Toale, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-dolben-96b526/&quot;&gt;William Dolben&lt;/a&gt; (CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contentednet.com/corporate/content/solutions&quot;&gt;ContentEd&lt;/a&gt;, which offers “a complete publishing service for the pharmaceutical industry”), a company called JSI Communications (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jsi.co.uk/&quot;&gt;medical communications company&lt;/a&gt; owned by John Stolz, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.sys.mac.misc/2005-09/msg00037.html&quot;&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; also to have also acted as a Dove commissioning editor) and the T&amp;amp;A Hill Family Trust (which I assume is connected with Tim Hill).

If so, why did it go ahead with the purchase? What exactly does T&amp;amp;F do in terms of due diligence before it acquires another company?

We were satisfied that, after some historical issues, improvements had been made to their peer review process working with the OASPA membership team. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/dove-medical-press-reinstated-as-oaspa-members/&quot;&gt;led to their OASPA membership being reinstated&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in an extremely robust peer review process described in detail in their peer review schematic on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/editorial_policies.php?content_id=3526&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, some of the additional checks they have added since that schematic was published go way beyond what most publishers do in their peer review process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These are in addition to the usual ethical checks which quality medical journals perform, and include: checking the affiliations of all authors and checking retractionwatch.com to identify whether any of the authors have been involved in unethical practices; manuscripts being checked for duplicate submission or publication and run through the SciDetect software; and IP address checks to make sure that there is no COI between author, reviewer and Editor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Due diligence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Publishing a schematic is surely a good idea. What is key, of course, is routinely following that process. But you didn’t answer my question: what exactly does T&amp;amp;F do in the way of due diligence before it acquires another company?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; All papers submitted to Dove go through the same rigorous process which, as I said, is more rigorous than that on the schematic and than many I have seen in other publishers. Any implication that this is not routinely followed is unfounded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As far as due diligence is concerned, as part of Informa, all acquisitions by Taylor &amp;amp; Francis go through a very detailed and thorough due diligence. Cross-functional teams of experts from Finance, Legal, Tax, Treasury and Communications meet weekly with the business leads to analyse and assess the risks and considerations concerning any acquisition and follow a detailed process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;No acquisition is complete until all questions are answered in detail, and there has been a thorough review by Informa’s senior management. This process was followed with this acquisition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: On Dove’s membership of OASPA: I think it would be fair to say that this has been more of an on-off affair than the above might imply. The timeline is this: Dove joined OASPA in late 2009; Dove withdrew from OASPA on 7th April 2010; Dove applied to join again in May 2012; Dove was re-accepted on 12th July 2012; Dove’s membership was terminated by OASPA on 5th November 2013. Dove reapplied in June 2015 and was accepted on 23rd September 2015.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is not clear is why Dove withdrew from OASPA in 2010. What we do know is that it occurred in the wake of the Amy Bishop affair, in which publicity was given to a controversial paper authored by her and published by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/international-journal-of-general-medicine-journal&quot;&gt;Dove’s International Journal of General Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Controversially, Bishop added the names of her minor children as co-authors of the paper. At the time (February 2010) I &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2010/02/open-access-linked-to-alabama-shooting.html&quot;&gt;wrote an article&lt;/a&gt; about the incident in which I raised the issue of ownership and transparency, and quoted Peter Suber saying, “I am deeply suspicious of publishers who are unwilling to disclose their owners. We need that kind of transparency to be able to investigate whether the owners have financial interests, e.g. with pharma companies, that might compromise the integrity of their journals.” When I asked OASPA for the reason Dove had withdrawn I was told, “We had a few exchanges by email following your article and they then withdrew their membership. I asked them if they could give me a reason but they gave none.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here it is worth noting that co-founder of OASPA Gunther Eysenbach &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/response-to-the-recent-article-in-science/#comment-5201&quot;&gt;has repeatedly alleged&lt;/a&gt; that Dove engages in “questionable publishing practices”. And at the time when OASPA terminated Dove’s membership in 2013 he referred back to the Amy Bishop paper and said that it had disappeared from its website without “any proper retraction notice/process”. (The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/effects-of-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-on-motor-neuron-sur-peer-reviewed-article-IJGM&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; appears to have been reposted later, again with no indication of its disappearance and reappearance). This will all be part and parcel of what you call Dove’s “historical issues”, but did none of this really give T&amp;amp;F any pause for thought? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I have already discussed the very detailed due diligence we went through which satisfied us that there are no issues that should concern us with their operations. And in working closely with Dove in the eight months since the acquisition, I have been impressed by their high standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is absolutely no evidence of any misconduct on Dove’s part, and despite persistent attempts to find some over the years, it doesn’t seem that you have evidence of any wrongdoing either. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is clear that in the two cases you mention, Bishop and Bohannon, authors who set out to deceive the system managed to do so. This showed up some inadequacies in the peer review processes of those journals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result of the Bohannon sting in 2013 and their OASPA membership being terminated, Dove worked closely with OASPA to improve their editorial processes and the OASPA Membership Committee were satisfied with those improvements. As I mentioned earlier, Dove also continue to enhance those processes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: While we are on the historical issues, in 2011 I was contacted by a US-based publisher who said that Dove had on two occasions launched a journal “identical or nearly identical” to this publisher’s own journals. The publisher added that only after a great deal of pressure from them did Dove change the titles of the two copycat journals. The publisher also pointed out that nine of Dove’s journals had the same EiC, many of which journals were unrelated to that EiC’s specialism. I do not know if this is still the case, but can you confirm that Taylor &amp;amp; Francis would not sanction such things? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; None of the current Dove senior management know anything about this allegation. Dove do have Editors-in-Chief who edit more than one journal, but only in their own specialist area and never more than two or three. Taylor &amp;amp; Francis also have some Editors-in-Chief editing multiple journals, but again only in their specific subject field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;New controversy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: As you note, many of these things may be historical issues. However, it seems that the controversy over Dove continues after the acquisition. Seven months after T&amp;amp;F purchased Dove, for instance, its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/W64GCqxV2vt8kO0ZYSw9okT?domain=dovepress.com&quot;&gt;International Journal of Women's Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; published &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/I1I7CrkEYwi8nAVEQSwP-n3?domain=dovepress.com&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; that has attracted some worrying criticism – as reported recently by STAT. The paper in question compared patient satisfaction with two competing devices for endometrial ablation, and concluded that the product developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/yfJsCv2YjAf7LWNxwCNJUzh?domain=minervasurgical.com&quot;&gt;Minerva Surgical&lt;/a&gt; was inferior to the competing product developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/RbqrCwpEkBHGVL8Klin2NQY?domain=hologic.com&quot;&gt;Hologic&lt;/a&gt; (which funded the study). On April 26th Minerva published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/weEmCxkVlDi1RJMkEU6eZLm?domain=prnewswire.com&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; alleging that the Dove article makes “material misleading statements” about the nature of the study and that this is “a clear violation of the COPE guidelines”. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in STAT, Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky say, “We can’t judge the essence of Minerva’s claims, although some — particularly that paid personnel for a device maker biased the selection process for patients in the trial — are quite troubling and would constitute grounds for retraction.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I raised this on Twitter, T&amp;amp;F &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/D8IeCyP6mEtr2NXZOtmXtBv?domain=twitter.com&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; that it was “currently working with the editor-in-chief to look into the concerns surrounding this paper”. But in light of Dove’s history does it not cause you some concern that this has occurred not long after the acquisition?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; It is an unfortunate fact of life that all publishers are having to field more and more disputes between academics and researchers. It is keeping COPE very busy, and there are few journals or publishers who have avoided being featured on Retraction Watch’s pages. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case of the &lt;i&gt;International Journal of Women’s Health&lt;/i&gt; paper our investigations show that the peer review was carried out to high standards and that the journal behaved well, and the authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; responses have satisfied us that the complaints are unfounded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As per ethical guidelines, we have offered the complainant the chance to write a Letter to the Editor with his concerns, which we would publish along with a response from the authors.

And are you implying that the cases COPE deals with are generally the result of disputes between academics and researchers, not of misconduct, faulty peer review or conflicts of interest?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Actually, I don’t. The fact that publishers are amending the scholarly record when they find that there are errors in the literature is a healthy thing.

In fact, this second paper finds that the rising number of retractions is most likely to be caused by a growing propensity to retract flawed and fraudulent papers, and there is little evidence of an increase in the prevalence of misconduct. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And no, you are misinterpreting my previous comment.

As I noted above, two of the other shareholders appear to have been running MECCs and/or providing publication services for pharmaceutical companies. Do you think that being a shareholder and/or MD of a medical publisher while also being the shareholder and MD or owner of a MECC might raise conflict of interest issues?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; This is a misunderstanding on your part. The MD of Dove was Philip Smith who did not run any other company. As for the shareholders, shareholders in any organization will have a number of interests. None of the shareholders you refer to played an active role in the organization or its operations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;COIs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: In March 2017 Dove &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prweb.com/releases/dove-press/nanomedicine-academy/prweb14143325.htm&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was sponsoring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.northeastern.edu/nanomedicineacademy/&quot;&gt;The Nanomedicine Academy of Minority Serving Institutions at Northeastern University&lt;/a&gt;. The Director and co-founder of this Academy is listed as being on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/journal-editor-international-journal-of-nanomedicine-eic5&quot;&gt;editorial board&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/international-journal-of-nanomedicine-journal&quot;&gt;The International Journal of Nanomedicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, which is a Dove journal and has an impact factor of 4.300. Its website also says that it is indexed in PubMed and Medline. As such, it would seem to be one of the journals that attracted T&amp;amp;F to Dove (In fact, it was singled out for mention in the Informa &lt;a href=&quot;https://informa.com/media/press-releases-news/latest-news/informa-extends-open-access-position-and-capability-with-addition-of-dove-medical-press/&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; you cited earlier). The EiC of the journal is the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.che.neu.edu/news/faculty/368?page=8&quot;&gt;co-founder&lt;/a&gt; of the Nanomedicine Academy, and appears to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/search_results.php?search_word=%22thomas+j+webster%22&quot;&gt;published over 100 papers&lt;/a&gt; with Dove, almost exclusively (if not exclusively) in his own journal (two of the papers seem to have been co-authored with the Director of The Academy). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I must assume that T&amp;amp;F would have established this during the due diligence process it undertook, and so is comfortable with the arrangement. But I cannot help but think that some would feel it raises conflict of interest issues. What would you say to those who might be concerned about it? Or am I simply misunderstanding the situation and how these things work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journals and Publishers often sponsor conferences and educational courses of various types. I think that if you look at the Academy, you will see that it is an academic partnership dedicated to providing education in nanomedicine to minority populations. This sounds like a great educational initiative, and I cannot see any COI from a Publisher donating to an initiative of this kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As far as the Editor publishing in his own journal is concerned, COPE guidelines do not preclude editors submitting to their own journals. They do expect journals to “have a procedure for handling submissions from editors or members of the editorial board that will ensure that the peer review is handled independently of the author/editor”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dove have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/editorial_policies.php?content_id=3523&quot;&gt;clear guidance&lt;/a&gt; on Editors publishing in their own journals whereby &lt;i&gt;“Editors-in-Chief must declare any financial and/or personal conflict of interest for each submitted manuscript, and decisions on manuscripts in which they have a conflict of interest will be made by another editor”. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;No Dove Editor is involved in the peer review of a paper that they are author on, and this is the case with the papers published by this editor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: After SAGE bought Dove’s sister company Libertas Academica it had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/ImX0CzpBnGHMwRg6WCLIc6L?domain=plus.google.com&quot;&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; that following “detailed review” it was unlikely that many of LA’s journals would be successful over the long-term. As a result, it shuttered over ¼ of those it had acquired. I wonder if Dove might have to do the same. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Twitter T&amp;amp;F &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/D8IeCyP6mEtr2NXZOtmXtBv?domain=twitter.com&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “When any list joins T&amp;amp;F we go through an integration phase where we check on all processes and standards and integrate / amalgamate the best of what both orgs do. This is a process that has happened with Dove and is on-going.” Do you anticipate having to close many Dove journals? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; As I said earlier, Libertas Academica had no connection with Dove and was not a sister company so there is no comparison between the two companies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is good publishing practice to regularly review the journals portfolio, and make changes accordingly. Dove had done this review prior to become part of Taylor &amp;amp; Francis and had decided to cease the publication of some journals which were not receiving enough quality submissions to sustain them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We reviewed this list together and agreed with their plans. Some of these journals were closed prior to the acquisition but not all had gone through the process by that point, so some are currently being closed. At the end of this process 92 journals will remain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Journal closures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: We may disagree over the definition of a sister company, but as noted earlier, the former MD of Libertas Academica is the son of Tim Hill. And according to New Zealand Companies House it was Tim Hill who registered LA, and he was listed as a shareholder until at least 2009. Does that not suggest to you that the companies were connected?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;  Please see my previous response on this. No Dove staff, now and previously, have ever been involved in the direction or operations of Libertas Academica.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: On the issue of journal closures, Wikipedia reports that in 2013 Dove published 131 journals. Unless I am miscounting, the Dove website currently lists 136 journals. This would seem to suggest that 44 (32%) of them are due to be closed – which is a higher percentage than were closed at LA. Is it normal for such a high percentage of journals to be closed after an acquisition? Is T&amp;amp;F still confident that it got value for money in buying Dove?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dove Press has launched 136 journals in the last 14 years. Some of these were not successful and were closed. It is not uncommon for this to be the case, and for publishers to close journals which are not thriving. When we acquired Dove they were publishing 109 journals, and we were aware of and agreed with their plans to close 17 of them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eight months on from our acquisition, Dove are performing well in all areas, we remain confident that we got value for money, and are delighted that they are part of Taylor &amp;amp; Francis Group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you for answering my questions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
