		<title type="html">The Language of Peer Review</title>
		<link href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2014/06/the-language-of-peer-review.html"/>
		<id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5648062351012720545.post-5354963117694657783</id>

		<content type="html">
 When I sent off the draft of my first paper to my PhD advisor I really felt like all the hard work was finished. I'd spent years getting my project started: getting IRB approval, identifying subjects, collecting data, and so on. Then I spent many more months analyzing the data, pouring over every detail. Then I spent many more months putting together figures and writing the draft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all of that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's only the tip of the iceberg. Let's get into my personal statistics (since those are the data from which I have to draw) to show you the language of peer review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few years I've been co-author on 15 research manuscripts, of which I have been the main author on 7. I currently have 3 more that have undergone at least one round of peer review. These 10 first-author manuscripts have &lt;i&gt;collectively&lt;/i&gt; undergone about 20 rounds of review, each consisting of 2-4 reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 16,000 words have been written by reviewers about these 10 papers. In response to &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;, I have written over 14,000 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, the total word length for all 10 of these papers comes in at around 40,000 or so (not including references). This means that, for every paper I write, I will probably have to write around 35% &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; than what I consider to be the &quot;final&quot; version in order to justify its publication to reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep that in mind next time you try to estimate how much longer it will take for you to publish your manuscript. I often forget this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on the flip side, I've performed approximately 25 reviews for some of the most prestigious journals in cognitive neuroscience including: &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neurology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cerebral Cortex&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For these 25 reviews I have written over 14,000 words. That may seem light at only ~560 words per review but my personal reviewing philosophy is to be concise but thorough. It is much easier to critique than to create!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not experienced it, peer review is a strange affair. It's sort of like a masquerade ball in that peoples' identities are unknown (at least in one direction), but you know that you'll probably have to see these people unmasked at some point so you better give the appearance of propriety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a lot of weird and interesting language play and kowtowing, with phrases such as &quot;we thank the reviewers for their insightful comments&quot; and &quot;this is a very interesting manuscript, but...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word of the day is &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asteism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asteism&lt;/a&gt;&quot;: &quot;Polite irony; a genteel and ingenious manner of deriding another.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This generally sums up the peer-review process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just out of curiosity I decided to run all my reviews, comments received by reviewers, and response to reviewers through a tag cloud generator (thank you &lt;a href=&quot;http://tagcrowd.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tagcrowd&lt;/a&gt;) just to see what it looked like. Check it out, I believe this to be a decent, quick insight into the language of peer-review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Reviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ3as2idf3M/T1VfSmCsKbI/AAAAAAAAECE/rJ6RcTSJI-g/s1600/bradley_voytek-reviews.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ3as2idf3M/T1VfSmCsKbI/AAAAAAAAECE/rJ6RcTSJI-g/s400/bradley_voytek-reviews.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You'll notice right away that certain keywords appear that represent the general class of manuscripts I'm asked to review: &quot;EEG&quot;, &quot;coupling&quot;, &quot;gamma&quot;, &quot;patients&quot;, and so on. The appearance of words such as &quot;addressed&quot;, &quot;important&quot;, and &quot;interesting&quot; belie the kinds of language I use (I generally &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; find most papers I review to be genuinely interesting, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments Received by Reviewers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDB1MAllh5I/T1WIZJTpHCI/AAAAAAAAECM/IBFCNxc-wH4/s1600/bradley_voytek-reviewer_comments.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDB1MAllh5I/T1WIZJTpHCI/AAAAAAAAECM/IBFCNxc-wH4/s400/bradley_voytek-reviewer_comments.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here again you see &quot;interesting&quot; appear. Everyone is interesting! We're all special snowflakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good exercise for me though because I can see that reviewers have a tendency to use words like &quot;specific&quot; and &quot;literature&quot; against me. When I write I have a tendency to &quot;jump ahead&quot; and just assume that people will follow my logic without &quot;showing my work&quot;. This is sloppy on my part and I struggle with the need to explicitly connect my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has to remind me of this fact for every. Single. Paper. That I write. For every talk I give. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response to Reviewers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vly8NYaRXnk/T1WIf_pl-pI/AAAAAAAAECU/GGpmC-k6NHg/s1600/bradley_voytek-response_to_reviewers.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vly8NYaRXnk/T1WIf_pl-pI/AAAAAAAAECU/GGpmC-k6NHg/s400/bradley_voytek-response_to_reviewers.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great. You see how &quot;reviewer&quot;, &quot;correct&quot;, &quot;thank&quot;, and &quot;suggested&quot; show up a lot in my response to reviewers? This is another interesting aspect of peer review. This shows the deferential language that scientists use in responding to their peers. This represents all the times I've said, &quot;the reviewer is correct&quot; and &quot;we thank the reviewers for their suggestions&quot; and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this was my attempt to peel back the curtain on peer review a bit if you don't have a lot of experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have a clever or insightful ending for this post, so, uh, I'd like to thank the readers for their valuable time and for the intelligent, thought-provoking comments that are sure to follow.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Resting-Bear-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pleistocene was a time when giant mammals were common in Europe. One of them was the cave bear. This species is one of the most abundant fossil taxa from Europe due to its strategy of surviving the winter by resting, and consequently sometimes not surviving, in caves [1]. Thus, many fossil remains are perfectly preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most researchers agree that cave bears were predominantly herbivorous and mostly ate soft leaved plants such as herbs [2]. When I started my research on the brain size of cave bears, I was confronted with a short anecdote of the “stupid,” plant eating bear in the cave. The basis for this was the idea of an evolutionary brain size arms-race between predator and prey, where predators needed to always be smarter [3]. Here, it is important to note that overall or relative brain size does not necessarily reflect intelligence [4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to look further into this anecdote and see if there is any validity to it. Thus, I started to collect data on dietary preferences of all studied bear species [2] and scored them on a scale where leaf consumption would result in small brains, and animal protein consumption in big brains. Additionally, I also wanted to see if the annual cycle of fattening up for the winter and starving until spring affected the costly brain matter [5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9104&quot; style=&quot;width: 5716px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9104&quot; height=&quot;1554&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/MethodsPicture.jpg&quot; width=&quot;5706&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Difference in brain volume between polar bear (left) and cave bear (right) (skulls are stored in PIMUZ, Switzerland). Glasses are filled with 6 mm glass beads as representation of the different brain volumes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Kristof Veitschegger &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research showed that neither diet nor dormancy alone had a significant effect on the relative brain size of cave bears. Thus, the results do not give validity to the anecdote of the “stupid,” plant eating bear. However, there was a weak environmental influence that affected the brain size of cave bears as is shown in the combined score of diet and dormancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to understand the effect that body size had on the brain of cave bears. Cave bears were one of the biggest bear species ever to roam the earth and body mass estimations are between 225 and 1,500 kg [1, 6]. My research showed that the body mass of cave bears increased at a much higher pace than brain mass. Thus, cave bears ended up with small brains compared to their body size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are increasingly encouraged to communicate directly with non-experts, through newspaper and TV interviews, science festivals, online videos, and other channels. But the quality of their research or ideas alone is not enough to guarantee interest or support, suggests &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/05/16/1620542114.full&quot;&gt;a series of new studies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt;. The way the general public responds is also influenced by the scientist’s facial appearance, an important finding, say the researchers, because the public communication of scientific findings shapes beliefs, opinion and policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24667&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To probe the potential impact of first impressions, the researchers, led by William Skylark at the University of Cambridge, first obtained photographs of the faces of hundreds of male and female scientists, chosen at random from physics, genetics/human genetics and biological sciences departments of US and UK universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of participants then rated these faces on a variety of social traits, relating to competence, sociability and morality (essentially, trustworthiness), as well as on attractiveness and perceived age. Other groups indicated how interested they would be in finding out more about each scientist’s research or how much the person looked like someone who conducts accurate and important research (the extent to which they looked like a “good scientist”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were more interested in learning about the work of scientists who were physically attractive and who appeared competent and trustworthy (though sociability judgements had little effect). When it came to judgements of the quality of these scientists’ work, however, while apparent trustworthiness and competency were again important, those scientists who’d ranked &lt;i&gt;lower&lt;/i&gt; for physical attractiveness and sociability generally got better scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further study with a different group of volunteers found that they rated research (described in an apparent magazine article) as being of higher quality when it was paired with a photo of a scientist who’d previously received a high “good-scientist” rating, compared with research paired with a photo of a scientist with a lower “good scientist” rating. (In fact, the scientists in the photos were not responsible for the work described in the articles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings show that the very traits, as judged from appearance, that can engage the general public in a scientist’s work are distinct from – and even opposite to – the traits that encourage the belief that the scientist does high-quality work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Notably, these sociocognitive traits ‘trumped’ the influence of age, gender, and ethnicity – variables that are the primary focus of much work on stereotypes and bias, implying an underlying source of influence that has received little attention public discourse or academic studies of scientist stereotypes,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of bias uncovered in this new research could have significant real-world implications. For example, in another of the new studies participants showed a preference for “interesting-looking” scientists when choosing which research videos they’d like to watch – a bias that would amount to tens or hundreds of thousands of extra views, the researchers noted. “Indeed the effect was particularly strong for video communications, and the rising use of video media such as TED talks means that face-based judgements are likely to play an increasing role in shaping the public’s engagement with scientific research,” Skylark and his colleagues wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because effective communication is increasingly important to scientists’ career progression, they argued, face-based biases may influence not just which scientists’ work gains popularity or acceptance among the public, but even which research is actually conducted, and by whom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings add to past research on superficial factors, such as the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2008.20040?journalCode=jocn&quot;&gt;jargon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.249/full&quot;&gt;imagery&lt;/a&gt;, and clarity in expression, that can influence whether a piece of scientific work is widely discussed and believed, or ignored and discredited.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the announcement last month (in Japanese), a committee investigated approximately 40 publications by Yuhji Saitoh of Yachiyo Medical Center and Tokyo Women’s Medical University in Japan.

The U.S. DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) estimates that Colombia's Putumayo province coca leaf cultivation produces 60 % of the world's cocaine with 3 tons a week for a value of four hundred million U.S. dollars.

&lt;p&gt;After a terror attack, amidst the shock and sadness, there is simple incomprehension: how could anyone be so brutal, so inhuman? In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0118&quot;&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Sandra Baez and her colleagues offer rare insight based on their tests of 66 incarcerated paramilitary terrorists in Colombia, who had murdered an average of 33 victims each. The terrorists completed measures of their intelligence, aggression, emotion recognition, and crucially, their moral judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24692&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most measures, such as intelligence and executive function, there were no differences between the terrorists and 66 non-terrorist control participants from the same region. The terrorists admitted to more aggression, as you’d expect, and they showed difficulties recognising anger, sadness and disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the most striking group difference concerned moral judgments on 24 different scenarios. Unlike control participants, the terrorists judged acts of intended harm with neutral outcomes (such as intending to poison someone, but failing) to be more morally permissible than acts of accidental harm (such as poisoning someone by mistake). In a follow-up, the terrorists also rated attempted harm as more morally permissible than accidental harm, as compared with a group of incarcerated non-terrorist murderers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baez and her team said this distorted approach to morality implies a problem weighing intentions combined with an excessive focus on outcomes, and it is similar to the moral perspective taken by very young children and by adult neurological patients with damage to the frontal lobe and temporal lobe of their brains (but not by psychopaths who do seem to weigh intentions when making their moral judgments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The profile observed in the terrorists may reflect their fixation on utopian visions whereby only (idealised) ends matter. That is, their outcome-based moral judgments may be related to the belief that any action can be justified,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research involved Colombian terrorists who had joined paramilitary organisations mainly for economic rather than ideological reasons. It remains to be seen if the specific deviant moral code uncovered in this research is also a characteristic of Islamist terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promising avenue for future investigation, the researchers noted, will be to see if careful tests of moral judgment could be used to predict likelihood of future offending in dangerous offenders; also to study whether and how radicalisation alters the nature of people’s moral judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I signed my contract renewal, and in August of this year I officially begin my third year as a professor in the Physics Department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Several friends and family have been asking me what comes next in terms of promotion and tenure, so I thought an update might be a nice way to revive this quiet blog. First, some background…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally entered my current position by responding to a open call for applications.  A few years ago, the university launched a new Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Physics, and in 2015 they opened up a search for faculty. I was one of two (both women!) professors offered a position that round. I officially started on August 1, 2015. Here’s where things vary from the system many academics in Canada, the U.S., and U.K. might be used to. Professors here in Mexico do not begin their faculty positions on the tenure track. For the first three years, we are on annual contract renewal, meaning I sign for one year at a time and my next year’s contract is based on an evaluation by the review board. Each December/January, I submit a progress report describing my teaching, research, service, etc., accomplishments for the year, and submit a new work plan outlining what I intend to accomplish in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, I have not received any official comments back on my evaluations; I simply know my annual review was successful when a letter arrives to my office informing me that my contract has been renewed. For this reason, it’s a little difficult for me to assess what the review board thinks of my progress so far, or if there are specific areas where they think I could improve.  The only unofficial comment has come from my program coordinator, who said the review board would like to see me publish more. I can’t disagree. But I do have two articles nearly ready to submit, so I’m hopeful my production will increase this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far, the toughest thing about my first two years has been the teaching load. Our minimum teaching load is 9 classroom hours per week, which works out to 2.5-3 classes per semester. I currently teach most of the bio- and physiology-related core courses for the program, including Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Human Physiology, Physics of the Human Body, and sometimes Intro to Physical Chemistry or Measurement and Analysis in Experimental Physics, depending on the semester and course demand. Only this semester did I begin to repeat courses, and was able to build on previous class preparation, rather than having to start entirely from scratch. This and a couple of great teaching aids this semester made a huge difference, and am hoping this trend continues. On another good note, my teaching evaluations have been very positive, and interactions with some great groups of students have been a highlight of my faculty experience so far. I have no shortage of passionate and interested students. The questions from them in class this semester got tough, but I think that’s a good problem to have!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I applied for and received my first grants as a Principal Investigator. Both grants are internal to UNAM, and each is for a maximum amount equivalent to around $10,000 USD, enough to buy some small equipment and consumables for the lab. A lab space wasn’t originally part of my hiring package, but by joining forces with a professor in Biology and another in Mathematics and collectively bringing in funding from a few different sources, we now have a collaborative space that is used for both original research and training activities. One of my grants is for a research project to study aging in the hippocampus, both computationally and experimentally. All the code, data, and research products generated will be shared under open licenses. The other grant is a teaching grant to develop electrophysiology laboratory practicals for the Biomedical Physics undergrad program. All the materials produced under that grant will be shared as open educational resources. Overall, I’m hugely grateful to have funding and a lab space I didn’t think I would ever have. But I must admit it is daunting and slightly terrifying to now have to deliver all the things I promised in my proposals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that’s where things stand nearing the end of year two. What comes next? Year three is a critical year. Right now, I am not yet eligible for promotion or tenure. To become eligible, I will first have to win a public competition for my position (another, apart from the one I successfully won to be given the position in the first place). In short, a job description is written up, reviewed by internal committees, and then published in our university newspaper. The ‘test’ materials that have to be submitted for the application vary by department, and in my case will most likely include at least a research proposal and a critical essay on some aspect of the plan of study or core course in Biomedical Physics. Departments may also ask for other ‘tests’, such as oral presentations or essays on current issues in your field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you are intended to be the ideal candidate for the job — the description is such that it fits your profile and you have a history with the university after having taught there for three years by the time the process is complete – -anyone can apply for the position. And the position can be taken away from you if the review committee prefers another candidate in the competition. It is not clear how often this happens, but it has happened enough that I know of multiple cases. If this occurs, that will most likely be the end of my stint as a faculty member at UNAM. My position will be taken over by the new person, and I will be asked to leave. It is possible I could be offered the equivalent of an adjunct position, paid per class, but I would not be eligible for promotion and tenure. This is why it is so important that I have all the boxes checked (good course evaluations, papers published, projects funded, students graduated, etc.) and can strongly demonstrate my worth to the department by the time the public competition for my position opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departmental process of writing the announcement, going through rounds of edits with internal review boards (there are rules about how these things should be phrased and what can be specified or not), and finally publishing the competition announcement can take up to a year. If you’re wondering why it takes so long, here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fciencias.unam.mx/comunidad/academicos/plazas&quot;&gt;flow chart provided by the Faculty of Science&lt;/a&gt; that explains all the steps involved in preparing and publishing the announcement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;COA&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2927&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;2927&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;COA&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://emckiernan.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/coa.png?w=736?w=736&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://emckiernan.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/coa.png?w=736?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://emckiernan.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/coa.png?w=736&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1099,895&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://emckiernan.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/update-on-life-as-a-new-prof/coa/&quot; src=&quot;https://emckiernan.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/coa.png?w=736&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totally clear, right?! Anyway, this process should begin in August so that it is complete by the time I finish my third year. If I am successful in winning the public competition, the position will then officially be in my name. I’ve had some difficulty understanding exactly how all these processes work, since they are few official guidelines. But if I understand correctly, I should then be able to immediately request promotion and tenure. I am not sure exactly what I will need to submit to accomplish this or what the criteria are for a successful application; these are things I’m hoping to verify after the publication competition. Tenure comes with obvious benefits and stability, but promotion has its perks, too. Moving up to the next level will reduce my minimum teaching load from 9 to 6 classroom hours per week and allow me to advise doctoral students at UNAM (there are sometimes ways to do this before moving up, but it’s more complicated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that’s about it. In sum, I’m feeling very positive about how things have been going so far, but also a little apprehensive about what comes next. The only thing I can keep telling myself is, I am giving this my best shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With political tribalism a feature of our times, perhaps science could act as a unifying force. While faith in politicians and journalists is in the doldrums, surveys in countries like &lt;a href=&quot;http://angusreidglobal/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012.10.02_Professions.pdf&quot;&gt;Britain, Canada and the US&lt;/a&gt; suggest scientists are among the most respected professions, and citizens are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/public-praises-science-scientists-fault-public-media/&quot;&gt;appreciative&lt;/a&gt; of the contribution science makes to their lives. As the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0079&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt; note, it seems that “we may disagree on emotionally charged social issues, but at least we can agree on science&lt;i&gt;”.  &lt;/i&gt;Sadly, their findings show that it’s not so simple. Although politically diverse people may be fans of science, we’re not fans of the same science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24637&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Feng Shi at the University of Chicago, explored the book-buying habits of tens of millions of Americans by analysing two huge datasets belonging to Amazon and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, which encoded the purchase patterns that make possible recommendations like “customers who bought this item also bought…”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers coded over a million books in the databases: about half a million covered topics like art, fiction and sports; there were over 400,000 science books, categorised into different domains like life sciences and further into disciplines like medicine; and finally, there were political books, from which the researchers identified nearly 600 emphatically liberal books and another 700 conservative ones. The key question was, what other books were buyers of these “blue” (liberal-left in US parlance) and “red” (conservative) books also buying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, science books were more likely to be read by people also reading political books, regardless of ideology. And many disciplines of science, like chemistry or economics, were of similar interest to both red and blue readers. So far, so good. But many other disciplines were more favoured by one tribe. Liberals were far more drawn to engineering, anthropology, and purer sciences like biology, astronomy or to a lesser extent physics. Conservatives were drawn more to applied disciplines such as medicine and law, and – in the highest association for the red tribe – climate science. (This may seem surprising, but we’ll come back to it shortly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, when you scrutinise the sciences that appear to be equally favoured, you find polarisation is still happening, just at a more fine-grained level. Digging into chemistry, for example, reveals its most applied branch (organic) is very strongly red whereas zoology is exceptionally blue. Even within subfields that have interest to both tribes, like criminology, conservatives and liberals are siloed into reading different authors (palaeontology was one of the rare exceptions to this rule).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science books read by conservative readers also tended to be less varied, such as the same three climate books cropping up repeatedly, whereas liberals tended to read more widely across an area. The conservatives narrower choices also appeared to contain more fringe publications rather than core texts. This may explain why the analysis appeared to suggest that conservatives are more interested in climate change: they were dipping into the same minority of books sceptical of climate change, but generally they weren’t reading on the topic more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous purchasing patterns may provide access to true preferences, getting round the potential problem of people hiding their unpopular beliefs in surveys. That said, the new findings may give a somewhat distorted picture of people’s true interests because the recommendation algorithm used by Amazon and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble pushes similar consumers towards the same choices (even so, the findings still provide another demonstration of the way filter bubbles may be shaping how we approach the world). Together with the filter effect, the authors also consider the possibility that “scientific puzzles appeal more to the left, while problem-solving appeals more to the right” as an explanation for the preferences for pure and applied science respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is a powerful engine for finding truth. But truth pursued too selectively can cause problems, in this case via political cultures each with a partial picture of the world, each &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/25/new-studies-suggest-liberals-are-as-blinkered-and-biased-as-conservatives/&quot;&gt;increasingly talking past the other&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a big problem to tackle, but also a reminder that if we’re willing to poke our heads above the parapet, there’s an unseen world out there just waiting for our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0079&quot;&gt;Millions of online book co-purchases reveal partisan differences in the consumption of science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Marco Craveiro's journal club session where he presents the paper, &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11877028_2&quot;&gt;Model Driven Engineering: An Emerging Technical Space (Bézivin, 2006)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an emerging solution to the handling of complex and evolving
software systems, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is still very much in
evolution. The industrial demand is quite high while the research
answer for a sound set of foundation principles is still far from
being stabilized. Therefore it is important to provide a current state
of the art in MDE, describing what its origins are, what its present
state is, and where it seems to be presently leading. One important
question is how MDE relates to other contemporary technologies. This
tutorial proposes the ”technical space” concept to this purpose. The
two main objectives are to present first the basic MDE principles and
second how these principles may be mapped onto modern platform
support. Other issues that will be discussed are the applicability of
these ideas, concepts, and tools to solve current practical problems.
Various organizations and companies (OMG, IBM, Microsoft, etc.) are
currently proposing several environments claiming to support MDE.
Among these, the OMG MDATM(Model Driven Architecture) has a special
place since it was historically one of the original proposals in this
area. This work focuses on the identification of basic MDE principles,
practical characteristics of MDE (direct representation, automation,
and open standards), original MDE scenarios, and discussions of
suitable tools and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objectives of this talk are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide a general overview of Model Driven Engineering (MDE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cover some of the difficulties of this approach&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure to reproduce established psychology findings on &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;renewed testing&lt;/a&gt;, including some &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;famous effects&lt;/a&gt;, has been well-publicised and has led to talk of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/25/was-the-crisis-in-social-psychology-really-that-bad-have-things-improved-part-one-the-researchers-perspective/&quot;&gt;crisis&lt;/a&gt; in the field. However, psychology is a vast topic and there’s a possibility that the findings from some sub-disciplines may be more robust than others, in the sense of replicating reliably, even in unfavourable circumstances, such as when the participants have been tested on the same effect before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/rbz29&quot;&gt;new paper currently available as a preprint at PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt; has tested whether this might be the case for nine key findings from cognitive psychology, related to perception, memory and learning. Rolf Zwaan at Erasumus University Rotterdam and his colleagues found that all nine effects replicated reliably. “These results represent good news for the field of psychology,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24474&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested hundreds of participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website. Whichever cognitive effect they were tested on, each participant completed the test twice (either with the exact same stimuli or new versions), to see whether it made any difference to their behaviour or responses if they already had experience of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, all the effects in question were replicated on all occasions, whether on the first or second testing, and regardless of whether the specific stimuli – such as the words or pictures involved – were familiar or completely new.  The nine cognitive effects that showed this robustness were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Simon Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants had to press computer keys to indicate as fast as possible the colour of a on-screen circle. They were faster to respond if the appropriate keyboard key was on the same side of space as the circle they were responding to. This facilitatory effect of “stimulus-response” consistency is important for the design of human-machine interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flanker Task&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants had to press the correct keyboard key as fast as possible to indicate whether a target stimulus was a vowel or consonant. Participants were faster to respond if the target was surrounded by distracting letters associated with the same response (e.g. a target vowel surrounded by irrelevant, distracting vowels), as opposed to being surrounded by distractors associated with a different response (e.g. a vowel surrounded by consonants). The task shows how we can’t help but process irrelevant information to a certain degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Priming&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants had to press the appropriate keyboard key as fast as possible in response to left- or right-facing arrows flashed on-screen. Preceding arrows (known as a prime) gave advance warning of which way the target arrows would point: sometimes these primes were accurate, which led to faster performance, as you’d expect; if the primes pointed the wrong way, they slowed performance. Crucially, some of the primes were “masked” to make them subliminal (i.e. not consciously visible), in which case the effects were reversed, with primes pointing the wrong way leading to faster responses. The finding shows how information that’s not consciously perceived can affect our behaviour, and that it can have an opposite effect when subliminal than when consciously perceived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spacing Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were presented with dozens of words in sequence, with some of the words shown more than once in quick succession (i.e. the repetitions appeared close together in the sequence, known as “massing”); the repetition of other words was spread out in the sequence with other words appearing in-between (known as “spacing”). Tested on their memory for the words later, participants showed superior memory for the spaced words than the massed words, a basic phenomenon of memory that has important implications for learning and study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Memories&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were shown sequences of words of related meaning. Tested on their memory of the words later, participants were more likely to mistakenly say that a new word of similar meaning had been present in the earlier sequence than a new word with a meaning unrelated to the earlier list. This is a basic demonstration of the fallibility of memory and how easy it is to feel like we’ve experienced something before when we haven’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serial Position Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were challenged to remember lists of twenty words. They later showed better memory for words that appeared near the beginning and end of the lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associative Priming&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants had to indicate as fast as possible whether target words flashed on-screen were real words or non-words. They were faster to identify target real words if they’d been preceded by a word (a “prime”) of related meaning, consistent with the idea that activation spreads through networks of related information in the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetition Priming&lt;/strong&gt;: Presented with lists of words, some more common than others, participants had to indicate as fast as possible whether each word was a real word or a non-word. Some lists were repeated. Participants were faster to make their judgments when re-tested on a word shown earlier, and this priming effect was more pronounced for less common words – a finding that shows an interesting interaction between short-term memory (based on a recent encounter of a word) and long-term memory (based on how common the word is).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Shape simulation&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were shown successive pairs of sentences and pictures. For each picture they had to say whether the object it presented had featured in the preceding sentence. Participants were quicker to respond correctly to picture-sentence matches when the orientation of the object was similar in both cases – for example, if the sentence “The ranger saw the eagle in the sky” was followed by an image of a flying eagle as opposed to a perched eagle. The finding shows how we automatically represent the visual images implied by sentences we’ve read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zwaan and his colleagues said these positive findings are particularly encouraging, at least for cognitive psychology, because an increasing amount of research on memory and perception is now conducted online via Amazon Mechanical Turk and other survey websites. Also, the fact that these psychological phenomena held up even when the same participants were tested for a second time shows that they reflect fundamental, unchanging aspects of how our minds work. “It appears that these tasks are so constraining that they encapsulate behaviour from contextual variation and even from recent relevant experiences to yield highly reproducible effects,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/fotolia_300251-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canine obesity needs to be regarded as a serious issue and one that can no longer be ignored. The dilemma is that an overweight dog is more difficult to exercise, as obesity gives rise to respiratory and musculoskeletal issues that also have a negative impact on a dog’s quality of life and an already short lifespan.  Obesity can also increase the risk of other chronic diseases such as canine diabetes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-10-131&quot;&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, making canine obesity an important health concern in veterinary medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-016-0899-x&quot;&gt;Weight control diets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-016-0899-x&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-9095 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/fotolia_694386-300x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and programs for dogs are met with varied success, and it has been reported that few dogs are able to maintain their optimal body weight if they have developed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-8-147&quot;&gt;metabolic disorder &lt;/a&gt;linked to being overweight. As such, prevention is always better than the cure, and knowledge of predictive markers linked to canine obesity would certainly help to control this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although studies in human obesity have identified that a high birth weight and weight-gain during growth are classed as early risk factors for obesity in adulthood, it was not known if the same was true of dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-017-0994-7&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;, a group of researchers from &lt;em&gt;LUNAM University&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nantes-Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in France performed a longitudinal study in growing dogs to investigate predictive factors that could explain becoming overweight and obese in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beagle dogs from ten different litters were kept in a controlled environment and followed for two years after birth. Keeping dogs in identical conditions enabled researchers to measure growth, body composition and hormonal variations throughout maturation with reduced external variables. Although the sample size was small, the study did demonstrate differences in the development of obesity and becoming overweight between dogs matched for age, sex and breed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was determined that some dogs, despite being from the same breed and kept in the same conditions, are more susceptible to fat gain.  Body weight of the mother and father were positively correlated to that of their offspring, highlighting a possible parental link to canine obesity that requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike humans, neonatal bodyweight did not appear to be correlated with becoming overweight later in life. The earliest predictive marker was thought to be at 2 weeks after birth, where it was observed that puppies which had a growth rate greater than 125% were significantly more likely to be in the “overweight” group; a finding that is comparable to human studies, which have shown that high weight gain in early life stages is associated with the development of adult obesity. However, it was unclear whether the dam’s milk and/or litter size had an impact on the overweight status. &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-9097 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/fotolia_100220-300x204.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These preliminary results are encouraging, and such knowledge about predictive factors of obesity should be used by breeders and veterinarians to make dietary recommendations earlier in life. Dogs with a high growth rate during the first two weeks and high body composition score at 7 months should be started on a restricted diet early on, to ensure dogs maintain a healthy weight and better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always advise speaking to your veterinarian if you are concerned about your dog’s weight before placing them on a calorie controlled diet.  However, we hope that a greater awareness of the causes and risks of canine obesity will help to “slim down” (sorry!) this current epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

Previous interviewees include &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/10/new-nih-biosketch-brings-opportunity-change/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bruce Alberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/open-data-projects-win-wellcome-trust-nih-and-hhmi-open-science-prize/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trevor Bedford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Here we present our conversation with Sandra Schmid from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7605&quot; style=&quot;width: 214px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7605 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/06/Dr.-Sandra-Schmid-214x300.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Image Credit: University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center&quot; width=&quot;214&quot; /&gt;Image Credit: University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Sandra Schmid has gained a reputation for academic strength and leadership, most recently as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/131128/sandra-schmid.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Professor and Chairman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the cell biology department at University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) Medical Center. She’s also gained a reputation for her honesty regarding varied issues, including the position of post-docs, “if it were a job, we’d pay you better and give you retirement benefits,” the training of faculty, “few of us as mentors, as Principal Investigators, were ever taught how to run a lab or how to mentor individuals” and how she participates in open discussion of research before publication “mostly over beers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schmid has been particularly vocal about the misuse of journal impact factors (JIFs) as a way to evaluate researchers and, as she claims, “the unfortunate consequences to the scientific community of their misuse.” At UTSW, Schmid’s home institution, there has been no overt discussion among the leadership regarding JIFs and where faculty should choose to publish. There is no formalized preference for high impact journals. “In fact, we celebrated the founding of &lt;em&gt;eLIFE&lt;/em&gt; [a journal which rejects the use of JIFs] and have faculty on the Editorial Board of the journal,” says Schmid. The JIF was “never intended to and indeed does not measure the quality or impact of the individual papers in a journal,” says Schmid. It was originally developed and commercialized by Eugene Garfield to help librarians decide on which journals they should spend their subscription dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals and institutions are being spuriously judged – by other scientists, funders, governing bodies and administrators – based indirectly on JIF, rather than directly on the quality and impact of their work,” Schmid wrote in “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/pls/web/docs/F-698959692/duzSpecial_AvH_M04_2015_WEB.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Negative Consequences of the Misuse of Journal Impact Factors for Scientific Assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” as part of the 8th Forum on the Internationalization of Sciences and Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flawed Statistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JIF is a statistic calculated based on the average citations of a selection of papers in a given journal. One major problem with the JIF is that citations are highly skewed, with most articles receiving fewer citations. Since citation distributions are skewed, averages are meaningless. “Indeed,” writes Schmid, there are journals that “flaunt their JIF in marketing material to authors that would ironically not accept papers reporting such flawed statistics.” This skewed distribution was clearly demonstrated last year through a collaboration between multiple publishers, including Université de Montréal, Imperial College London, PLOS, &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt;, The Royal Society, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; (see &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/impact-factors-do-not-reflect-citation-rates/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Measuring Up: Impact Factors Do Not Reflect Article Citation Rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;). The analysis, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/05/062109&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted on bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, showed that citation distributions of journals with clearly distinct impact factors greatly overlap—in other words that all journals publish many papers with similar lower numbers of citations, and few highly cited papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Better Option: Citation Distributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the bioRxiv analysis call for publishers to make publicly available the actual citation distributions of their journal’s articles, rather than rely on irrelevant and misleading JIFs. Since journals use many different techniques to artificially increase their impact factor, including publication of review articles (which are often more highly cited than the original research papers they review) and front matter, including commentary and mini-review articles (that generate citations but are not counted as “citable” content) comparison across journals is problematic. It is hoped that public disclosure of article citation distributions will lead to more granular comparisons and better informed decisions by authors on where to submit their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then and Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/schmid/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;senior investigator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with a long-established career and history of publishing quality work at all tiers of influence, what has changed for Schmid when deciding where to publish is that in the past, “journals had different purposes and different scopes” and that was good. Before there was the JIF there was an understanding of what journal went with what type of data. “We sent our best biochemistry to &lt;em&gt;Journal of Biological Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;; our best cell biology to &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;. If we happened upon a new and potentially important discovery, even before we understood mechanism, we’d communicate it rapidly in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; because they were three figure papers.” Before the advent of supplemental materials, more meaty, in-depth studies were published in non-page limited, subject-specific journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked in the post-print era, how do researchers decide where to publish, Schmid replies, “That is the unfortunate part.” A lot of the decisions are being made by postdocs telling her about impact factors, although she cautions that “publishing in high impact factor journals doesn’t mean it’s high quality work.” Early career researchers are looking at numbers as a distinguisher between journals, says Schmid, so her efforts are focused on getting these scientists to think more broadly. Her response and recommendation? First and foremost is to choose the journal where the work will get in front of the audience that matters the most. Schmid is crystal clear when outlining her main considerations for deciding where to publish her work and the work from her lab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the people who handle my paper able to identify qualified referees?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the editors going to understand the discussion and criticisms and be helpful in handling my papers; do they understand my field?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do my peers read and respect the content in this journal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unintended Consequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question for Schmid is how to get the “impact factor genie” as she calls it, “back in the box.” Why is this so important? Scientists and publishers often focus on the limitations of JIFs and the benefits of evaluating work at the article rather than journal level. However, there are more than just limitations to the JIF. According to Schmid there are very “specific and unintended consequences of the abuse of JIF as a tool for individual and institutional assessment.” Many of these, she notes, are direct; others are subtle, downstream ramifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deferred communication of discoveries that might launch new fields as reviewers and editors demand more information per paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discouraged follow-up or augmentative studies to verify results due to over-interpretation of findings for the purpose of artificially inflating a work’s value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misguided evaluation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty by their individual papers rather than the combinatorial impact of their work in context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wasted time and resources spent satisfying unnecessary demands of reviewers and editors in high-impact journals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demoralized early career researchers forced to package an entire thesis or postdoctoral project into one comprehensive paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Better Option: Article-Level Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps wanting to get that impact factor genie back in the box was more than a mistaken mixing of two idioms. The difficulty of reverting to a situation that formerly existed (putting the genie back in the bottle) combined with the repercussions of doing something that causes unexpected and unintended negative consequences (opening a Pandora’s box) does describe the situation the scientific community has with JIFs. Fortunately, this is not an impossible situation to remedy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/article-level-metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article-Level Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were developed by PLOS as a better means to assess research value in an electronically networked world. They are gaining acceptance across a broad swath of the scientific community, from scientists to funders and more, since they provide granularity, breadth and proximity (PLOS ALMs are updated daily to monthly, depending on source and age of the individual article). ALMs also allow different scholarly research outputs to be tracked, such as policy impact, datasets, software and code. Schmid also recommends simply using PubMed as a portal for assessing the influence of an article, stating, “from title to abstract to download is a good metric,” although not as complete as a suite of ALMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership in Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 as Schmid took up the position of Chair of the Department of Cell Biology at UTSW, she offered an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2013/09/beyond-cvs-and-impact-factors-employers-manifesto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;employer’s manifesto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (published as a &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; Careers column) on the approach her department would take in hiring new assistant professors. This manifesto promised “a better job of screening applicants—and to avoid inappropriate criteria such as journal impact factors.” The idea was to encourage applications from qualified candidates who “might feel sidelined because their paper has yet to be, or perhaps won’t be, published in a high-impact journal.” Schmid closed her column with an enthusiastic “Let’s run this experiment!” Four years later, she shared some of the results with PLOS. Using their Academic Jobs portal the entire faculty is engaged in viewing applicants and every candidate that has piqued the interest of even one faculty member is interviewed via Skype, removing the need for reaching a ‘consensus’ that might rely more on JIFs. Those few candidates whose programs are most likely to thrive in the department’s specific environment are invited to campus to visit. Since taking this approach “our new faculty are indeed thriving,” says Schmid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This approach suggests that a reduction on emphasis of JIFs in favor of more constructive and meaningful measures of evaluation, both quantitative and qualitative, fosters an assessment program that is both fair and thoughtful. This is how science should be; if it works for people it can work for research outputs as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 The regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian heart is limited because of the reduced ability of cardiomyocytes (CMs) to progress through mitosis1. The regenerative capacity of endogenous CMs exists at birth but is lost postnatally, with subsequent organ growth occurring through CM hypertrophy2,3. The Hippo pathway, a conserved kinase cascade, inhibits CM proliferation in the developing heart to control heart size and in the adult heart to prevent regeneration4,5. The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), a multicomponent transmembrane complex linking the actin cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix, is essential for CM homeostasis. DGC deficiency in humans results in muscular dystrophy, including lethal Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We found that the DGC component dystroglycan 1 (DAG1) directly binds to Hippo pathway effector Yap to inhibit CM proliferation. The Yap-DAG1 interaction was enhanced by Hippo-induced Yap phosphorylation, revealing a connection between Hippo pathway function and the DGC. After injury, Hippo-deficient postnatal hearts maintained organ size control by repairing the defect with correct dimensions, whereas postnatal hearts doubly deficient for Hippo and the DGC showed CM overproliferation at the injury site. In mature Mdx mouse hearts—a model of DMD—Hippo deficiency protected against overload-induced heart failure.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The adult mammalian heart is non-regenerative due to the post-mitotic nature of cardiomyocytes. The neonatal mouse heart can regenerate, but only for the first week of life. Here we show that changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during this week can affect cardiomyocyte growth and differentiation in mice. We identify Agrin, a component of neonatal ECM, as required for the full regenerative capacity of neonatal mouse hearts. In vitro, recombinant Agrin promotes the division of mouse and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes via a mechanism that involves the disassembly of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex and Yap and ERK-mediated signaling. In vivo, a single administration of Agrin promotes cardiac regeneration in adult mice after myocardial infarction, although the degree of cardiomyocyte proliferation observed in this model suggests additional therapeutic mechanisms. Collectively, we uncover a new inducer of mammalian heart regeneration, highlighting fundamental roles of the ECM in cardiac repair.

 Ten years ago, ketamine was a drug best known for its popularity on the rave scene. Yet it has since enjoyed a remarkable rebirth - as an antidepressant. Starting out with a handful of small clinical trials, there are now numerous reports that ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects. In the US, various clinics have sprung up offering ketamine treatment to depressed patients - at least the ones able to pay the bill, because insurance doesn't tend to cover it.

		<updated>2017-06-03T09:00:47+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/640px-St_Jamess_Park_Lake_–_East_from_the_Blue_Bridge_-_2012-10-06-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over half the world’s population today resides in cities, creating a challenge for urban planners to efficiently accommodate increasing numbers of residents in a healthy and positive environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental health in particular is important, with statistics showing that one in four of us experience mental health difficulties each year, while those with better, positive mental wellbeing display increased levels of longevity, productivity, and prosperity. In fact, the UK government now measures mental wellbeing, alongside traditional GDP, as an indicator of national progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biophilia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research found those in greener urban environments &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612464659)&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; fewer symptoms of mental distress and better life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory of Biophilia suggests that individuals have an innate desire to connect with nature, due to the savannah landscapes humans evolved in, and are hence best adapted to. People may therefore still experience positive emotions in more natural environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested this to be true in a modern context, where those in greener urban environments &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612464659)&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; fewer symptoms of mental distress and better life satisfaction. In particular, these symptoms have been shown to reduce for individuals &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es403688w&quot;&gt;relocating to greener areas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore important that green spaces are designed into urban areas to provide places for individuals to connect with nature. These spaces may also offer opportunities to pursue other health-promoting behaviours such as exercising, active travel, preserving wildlife, and socialising, which can help foster a supportive network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental wellbeing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, little research has focused on mental wellbeing, a concept which comprises positive aspects of mental health, such as happiness, functioning and purpose in life. Our study set out to examine whether local-area proportions of green space would be associated with this broader definition of mental wellbeing, measured using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). This questionnaire consists of 7 questions, asking respondents how they have been feeling over the past 2 weeks, covering aspects such as optimistic about the future, relaxed and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9091&quot; style=&quot;width: 391px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9091 &quot; height=&quot;272&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/800px-Park_in_bath_england_arp.jpg&quot; width=&quot;381&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Parade Gardens, Bath&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial results showed that green space was positively associated with the mental wellbeing measure, but after controlling for a range of personal and environmental factors, we found that individual lifestyle factors and local-area deprivation were significant predictors of mental wellbeing, while green space was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this was not the finding we expected, it opens up many other questions regarding the relationship between green space and mental wellbeing. It could be that defining local-area green space as the amount within a census boundary is too coarse a measure, as in this project, and that taking account of how far people have to travel to visit their nearest green space, may yield more positive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green space itself is also much more complex than a single entity, and may take the form of a nature reserve, park, sports pitch, cemetery, allotment, or many others. We speculate that the features of these different places may be beneficial in themselves, and we have begun pursuing investigations into the associations between these different green characteristics and mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that individual lifestyle factors and local-area deprivation were significant predictors of mental wellbeing, while green space was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also be that potential benefits depend on the individuals themselves. For example, older people may prefer green spaces with benches and toilets available, whilst young families may find play equipment and open spaces preferable. Those who commute may have more opportunity to benefit from green space nearer their workplace than home, or areas traversed while commuting, as this is where they spend most of their time during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads on to the concept of exposure: while studies do not agree whether having greater amounts of local green space is associated with usage, examination of visiting patterns and activity types may also be an interesting area of further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is clear, however, is that future studies need to examine different green space characteristics in association with this broader definition of mental wellbeing, in order to understand if, and where, these relationships exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal studies will also allow potential consideration of causality. Our future research will focus on a spatial modelling approach to expand our understanding of accessibility and the importance of these different green space types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With urban growth currently increasing at an unprecedented rate, there is rising pressure on city planners to ensure that limited space is put to its optimum use. Green spaces are only present in urban areas at the expense of buildings, and as such it is important that they are designed well to offer to greater benefit to the widest population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informed green space design will help create a healthier, happier and more productive urban landscape, while there may be wider benefits still for the environment and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Immagine1-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Digital revolution is changing the world: computers and Digital devices are now part of our life, and Dentistry is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of Dentistry is Digital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital technologies are rapidly advancing in Dentistry. In fact, fast and accurate devices for 3D models/image acquisition such as intraoral scanners, desktop scanners, face scanners, and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) – as well as powerful software for data elaboration/processing such as computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software for prosthodontics, surgery, and orthodontics – have been introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, new materials for prosthetic restorations – zirconia, lithium disilicate, and ceramics – have been proposed, along with innovative fabrication procedures such as milling, 3D printing, and layered manufacturing. These new devices, software, materials and fabrication methods are already changing the way we treat our patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Digital revolution has begun. In the coming months and years there will be a further, huge flood of new improvements and newly introduced devices, software and machines. The Digital technologies will dramatically change the world of dentistry, changing patients’ expectations towards dental treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, dental professionals need to change the way they think, communicate and work, to adapt to this new fascinating scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of Dentistry is Digital, therefore &lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health&lt;/em&gt; is happy to launch a section entirely dedicated to the world of Digital Dentistry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/digital-dentistry&quot;&gt;This section &lt;/a&gt;will collect high quality original research articles, clinical studies, technical advances, and case reports focused on the different areas of Digital Dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential topics of this section will include intraoral, desktop, and face scanners; CBCT and new imaging techniques in dento-maxillofacial radiology; CAD/CAM softwares in digital dentistry; digital prosthodontics; new materials (zirconia, lithium disilicate, and others) in digital dentistry; milling, additive manufacturing and 3D printing in dentistry; guided implant surgery; custom-made bone regeneration; custom-made implants; and digital orthodontics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to receiving your article. Let’s go Digital!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the first article published in the Digital Dentistry section, authored by Dr Mangano, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-017-0383-4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/15730249079_01affe8bc2_k-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unintentional drowning is a global concern, which encompasses all cases of drowning and their associated outcomes – morbidity, no morbidity, and death. As a water-centered society, Finland faces one of the highest rates of this in the developed world. In fact, an extensive population-based study (1970-2000) revealed over 9000 unintentional drownings, and named alcohol consumption as a key risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4306-8&quot;&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pajunen et al studied data from a nationwide survey provided by the Laboratory of Forensic Toxicology at the University of Helsinki. Already knowing that psychotropic drugs can impact psychomotor functioning and cognition, their aim was to determine if this was another potential risk factor associated with unintentional drowning. The dataset they used spanned over a 10-year period (2000-2009) and included 2,828 cases of fatal drownings; however, some cases were excluded from this study based on the manner of drowning e.g. accident, suicide, homicide, undetermined intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the authors carried out post-mortem toxicology for the 1,746 eligible cases, with 100% of these tested for alcohol, and 91.5% subjected to a full toxicological analysis to test for both alcohol and other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this testing, two of the authors of this paper used a well-established 6-grade scale to independently evaluate the contribution of each drug to fatal drowning, and then a summary score for each drug. The scoring process also considered factors such as drug concentration, concentration-dependent impairment, post-mortem changes and redistribution of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data reinforced the previously reported concentration-effect relationship between alcohol and drowning, which make it almost undeniable that alcohol consumption contributes to drowning during aquatic activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of medicinal drugs on unintentional drowning has been less well studied, thus this article may be considered unique by evaluating both the individual and combined effects of several drugs. The findings suggest that psychotropic drugs may also play a significant role in unintentional drowning, as it became apparent that they contributed to up to 14.6% of cases, whether taken independently or in addition to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the analysis revealed over 70 different psychotropic drugs, with benzodiazepines as the most commonly taken. This result might be most relevant to health professionals and their patients – as this class of drug is already known to affect cognitive and psychomotor skills, appropriate caution and warning is imperative for those patients engaging in aquatic activities; especially those likely to consume alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, among the 10 most common psychoactive and non-psychoactive drugs detected in the case samples, several may contribute to fatal drowning by causing drug-induced long-QT syndrome. This is a condition causing an abnormal heart rhythm, thereby affecting the normal pumping of blood in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unintentional drowning is an issue which has warranted nation-wide drowning-prevention campaigns already.  Whilst the role of alcohol in such cases is fairly well studied, that of medicinal drugs has only just been considered in detail, and further investigation is still required to determine the mechanism of drug actions involved. In light of this, however, this study suggests that appropriate information should be conveyed to the public to ensure that they are aware of the risks associated with their medical status, lifestyle, and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your personality describes your behavioural tendencies, your habits of thought and ways of relating to the world. For instance, some of us find it a lot harder to keep our negative emotions in check, which is measured by the Big Five personality trait of neuroticism (or “emotional instability”). It seems logical that people with this kind of disposition might be more prone to developing mental health problems like anxiety and depression, and indeed many studies suggest this to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a scientific perspective, however, it’s not clear which comes first: perhaps mental health problems contribute to a more neurotic personality, or maybe living through adversity contributes to a neurotic personality and mental health difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-017-0796-8&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class=&quot;JournalTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; helps clarify the picture because it is the first, to the researchers’ knowledge, to look simultaneously at people’s personality, life events and mental health problems as they unfold over time. Though they come with important caveats, the findings suggest that some people have a personality profile that predisposes them to mental health problems, to more serious mental health problems when they occur, and even to more adverse life events.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24294&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data come from a cohort of nearly 600 participants in Switzerland, who were first interviewed in 1979 when they were aged 19 to 20 about their mental health, any problems with drugs or alcohol, and their family background. The researchers led by Michael Hengartner at Zurich University then interviewed the same group again about their mental health and any experiences of relationship break-up and/or job loss in 1981, 1988, 1993, 1999 and finally in 2008 (now aged 50 years, 335 of the original sample were still participating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also completed measures of their personality in 1988 when they were aged 29-30 and again in 1993 when aged 34-35: specifically, these questionnaires revealed their levels of aggressiveness (including lack of self-control), extraversion (how cheerful and self-confident) and neuroticism (including their day-to-day emotional instability and propensity to worry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after controlling for family background and education, the researchers found that personality – averaged across the two times it was measured – was strongly related to the likelihood of experiencing mental health problems through the study: for instance, higher neuroticism was associated with increased odds of depression and anxiety and drink or drug problems. Higher extraversion, by contrast, was associated with less risk of mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantifying the personality-mental health link, the researchers said that “persons scoring high on aggressiveness and neuroticism and low on extraversion had an approximately 6 times increased risk for internalising disorder [a catch-all term for various depression and anxiety-related conditions] compared to persons scoring low on aggressiveness and neuroticism and high on extraversion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adverse life events were also associated with risk of mental problems: for example, and perhaps unsurprisingly, participants who endured job losses and relationship breakups were more likely to develop major depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But personality and life events were not independent factors. Personality was related, albeit weakly, to the likelihood of experiencing negative life outcomes: participants who scored higher on aggressiveness were more likely to go through job losses and relationship breakups through the course of the study, and higher scorers on neuroticism were more likely to go through job losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, adverse life events were more strongly associated with future mental health problems for participants with more neurotic personalities. And finally, when mental health problems occurred, they tended to be more severe for participants with more neurotic personalities (differences in trait neuroticism accounted for over half the variation in severity of problems between participants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings stress the fundamental role of personality, mainly neuroticism, for the occurrence, persistence and severity of psychopathology [i.e. mental health problems]” the researchers said, adding: “Our data further highlight that the relationship between critical life events and psychopathology is at least in part moderated by personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new findings complement &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/07/many-of-the-same-genes-that-influence-our-personality-also-affect-our-mental-health/&quot;&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; that’s shown that many of the same genes that influence personality are also involved in mental health disorders. They also dovetail with the recent finding that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/19/a-little-discussed-effect-of-therapy-it-changes-your-personality/&quot;&gt;psychotherapy is associated with reductions in trait neuroticism&lt;/a&gt;, and with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2629064&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; out of Sweden involving over a million men that found their teenage personality, especially their neuroticism, was related to their future chances of being diagnosed with severe mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hengartner and his team make no claims about the precise nature of the cognitive and neural mechanisms that might underlie a neurotic personality and a vulnerability to mental health problems, but they propose that the personality-mental health link can be understood in terms of “life history strategy” – an idea from evolutionary biology that notes how some of us follow a fast strategy (a short-term approach to life which can pay off in high risk environments), whereas others follow a slow strategy (playing a longer, more patient game). Seen this way, people with more impulsive, nervous, aggressive personalities are well-adapted for the fast life, but at the cost of being at much greater risk for mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this comes with some weighty caveats, most notably that despite the longitudinal nature of this study, it’s still not proven which way the causal arrow points between the different factors involved. In particular, it’s unfortunate that the first personality measure wasn’t taken until the participants were aged 29, raising the possibility that participants’ personalities had already been shaped by mental health issues and life events before that time (though the researchers argue this is unlikely, especially in light of past research showing that personality traits are relatively stable through young adulthood. In other words, they think their participants’ traits as measured at age 29 and 34 are probably much the same as they would have been if measured at the start of the study at age 19/20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that because of its roots in the 1970s and 80s, the study depended on personality measures that are now somewhat obsolete; in particular some aspects of personality such as Openness were not studied at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A strong association between personality and psychopathology may imply causation, but this is not necessarily true,” the researchers admitted. “Genetically and environmentally informed long-term prospective studies beginning in childhood are, therefore, required to better understand the causal role of personality traits in the occurrence and course of severe psychopathology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this idea that some people’s personalities render them more vulnerable (to mental health problems and adverse life events) is borne out by future research, it could allow help and support to be targeted at those likely to be need it most. It also raises the interesting question of whether future mental health problems might be averted by helping youth to develop more resilient personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/06/new-feature-for-requesters-add-collaborators-to-your-order/"/>
		<id>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=1076</id>
		<updated>2017-06-01T22:05:31+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;by Elizabeth Iorns, Co-Founder &amp;amp; CEO, Science Exchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science, by its very nature, lends itself to collaboration. At Science Exchange, we endeavor to make discovery and access to scientific services as easy as possible – while also improving researchers’ ability to collaborate effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With that goal in mind, we have released the Requester Collaboration feature. This feature allows requesters of scientific services to invite and manage additional collaborators for a project. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of collaborators include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A member of your organization’s accounting team who needs to view the project to make payment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A colleague helping you to work through the project details with the service provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;An administrator seeking a high level overview of research activities of their organization on Science Exchange. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new feature will enable:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Intuitive addition of collaborators to existing projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transparent communication between collaborating requesters and the service provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Easy transfer of ownership between requesters/collaborators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We will continue to listen to our users and bring new features to our platform to facilitate scientific discovery. To learn more about the Requester Collaboration Feature, view our video demo or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;check out the Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; below. If you’d like a personal demo of this feature or the Science Exchange marketplace, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;submit a request here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requester Collaboration Feature Video Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requester Collaboration Feature Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What can collaborators do?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Invited collaborators will see the order on their Science Exchange Dashboard. The collaborator can access the order page, post messages, accept quotes, and mark orders as completed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;How will collaborators be notified?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaborators will get email notifications regarding new messages that have been posted to the order page. They can also reply to the new message email notification from their inbox and the response will be posted to the order page. However, they will not get email notifications when the provider generates a quote for the request or that the order has been completed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does this change what the primary Requester can do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are no changes for the primary Requesters — they can still do everything, e.g., post messages, accept quotes, and mark orders as completed. As the primary Requester, you will also be notified via email of main updates regarding the order, e.g., messages, quotes submitted, quotes accepted, provider completing the order. However, you can transfer the ownership of the order to a collaborator so that they become to primary Requester.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I invite a collaborator?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Go to the order page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On the right-hand side, under “Researchers,” you’ll see a link called “Manage.” Click on that link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Enter your collaborator’s email and then invite them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The collaborator will get an email from Science Exchange with the invitation. They should click on the green button in the email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The collaborator will (sign up for a Science Exchange account, and then) arrive at the order page.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaborator can post messages, accept quote, mark order as complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I transfer ownership of the order to my collaborator?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Go to the order page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On the right-hand side, under “Researchers,” you’ll see a link called “Manage.” Click on that link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You’ll see your collaborator’s name. Click on the blue “Make Owner” link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Still have questions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re happy to help! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/contact&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contact us &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;here with your questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2017-06-01T16:00:11+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT have developed a new method of electrically stimulating deep brain tissues without opening the skull&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1997, more than 100,000 Parkinson’s Disease patients have been treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical technique that involves the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2007/03/brainsurgery/&quot;&gt;implantation of ultra-thin wire electrodes&lt;/a&gt;. The implanted device, sometimes referred to as a ‘brain pacemaker’, delivers electrical pulses to a structure called the subthalamic nucleus, located near the centre of the brain, and effectively alleviates many of the physical symptoms of the disease, such as tremor, muscle rigidity, and slowed movements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DBS is generally safe but, like any surgical procedure, comes with some risks. First and foremost, it is highly invasive, requiring small holes to be drilled in the patient’s skull, through which the electrodes are inserted. Potential &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2117492/&quot;&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; of this include infection, stroke, and bleeding on the brain. The electrodes, which are implanted for long periods of time, sometimes move out of place; they can also cause swelling at the implantation site; and the wire connecting them to the battery, typically placed under the skin of the chest, can erode, all of which require additional surgical procedures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/jan/15/blowing-up-the-brain-to-reveal-its-finer-details&quot;&gt;Blowing up the brain to reveal its finer details&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2012/sep/14/memory-traces-in-a-dish&quot;&gt;Traces of memory in a dish | Mo Costandi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2017/jun/01/researchers-develop-non-invasive-deep-brain-stimulation-method&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Stanley Rapoport just can’t catch a break. Rapoport, who’s based at National Institute on Aging, is continuing to experience fallout from his research collaborations, after multiple co-authors have been found to have committed misconduct. Most recently, Rapoport has had four papers retracted in three journals, citing falsified data in a range of figures. Although the notices do not […]&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/children-403582_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recently updated American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, mentioned in the paper, highlight that our thinking around children’s screen time needs to take into account the ubiquity of screens. We not only need to be thinking about &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; they are watching, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they are watching as well (although psychologists have been telling us this for years). But now it’s not just enough to talk about watching TV, we have video games, tablets and smart phones to think about too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important question to ask is whether this proliferation of screens is accompanied by an increased awareness of screen time recommendations for children, a greater understanding of the dangers of too much screen time, and better skills for monitoring children’s screen use? It would seem not, and studies seem to indicate that parents view screen time as educational, a good babysitter, and a helpful bartering tool for dealing with uncooperative children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, Jago and colleagues report on some results from the B-Proact1v study with 5-6 year old children, based in the greater Bristol area in the UK. For this paper, they focus on the screen viewing of these children and their parents, who were classified according to their level of household deprivation and their child’s level of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, measured using activity devices called accelerometers. Parents were interviewed about their child’s screen viewing (how much and if they thought it was appropriate), who influences their child’s screen viewing, and the ways in which they manage their child’s screen viewing. Parents also completed a questionnaire about their own and their child’s screen viewing habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and children who went over the 2-hour mark had a less structured and more laid back family environment, with minimal rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the recommendation for school-going children is no more than 2 hours per day of screen time per day, parents and children who followed this recommendation were compared with parents and children who exceeded this 2-hour threshold. Not surprisingly, there were some clear differences, and these related to parents’ personal screen-related views and behaviors, the family environment, and setting rules and limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, parents and children who stuck to the &amp;lt;2 hour recommendation tended to have a family environment that encouraged activity, sought non-screen alternatives for family time, and were more likely to have rules that managed screen viewing time and content. In contrast to this, parents and children who went over the 2-hour mark had a less structured and more laid back family environment, with minimal rules and a tendency to choose screen viewing as the preferred activity for the family to relax together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings support previous work that has shown that, in comparison to permissive parents, authoritative parents who place some restrictions on the screen viewing tend to have children who spend less time in front of screens. Authoritarian parents are responsive to their children’s needs, but not afraid to put rules and limits in place, and this parenting style has been linked to a host of other positive outcomes in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study also indicates that there is much work still to be done on informing parents of the negative impact of non-educational screen time. And that relying on screens for their educational value has its shortcomings. Lastly, when life is busy and some downtime is needed, families can watch some TV or a movie together, but this needs to be balanced with other family activities that get everyone moving. Since screens are not going anywhere, the more that parents can strike a healthy balance, the better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely creativity is about freedom. Dropping your inhibitions – maybe with the help of a few substances – and letting ideas writhe free from the unconscious unfiltered. What to make then of the research showing that creativity is associated with higher levels of executive functioning – the mind’s suite of control processes – which seem to help by inhibiting irrelevant information and combining the rest in novel ways? Does it mean you can use this mental control to make yourself perform more creatively? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-14257-001/&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts&lt;/i&gt; involving jazz pianists the answer may depend in part on your creative experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24263&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Rosen and his team from Drexel University suspected that the need for conscious control may be more acute when creative people are still novices, referencing saxophonist Charlie Parker’s observation that &lt;i&gt;“you’ve got to learn your instrument. Then, you practice, practice, practice. And then, when you finally get up there on the bandstand, forget all that and just wail.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this, the researchers recruited 22 mostly male jazz pianists using their number of completed professional gigs – as few as three and as many as 400 – as a measure of their creative expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After warming up at the keyboard, the musicians attempted to improvise a pre-recorded track “as you normally would in a jazz setting.” After the first take, they were given three more tries. Crucially, before one of these efforts they were told that from now on they should “improvise even more creatively than your past performance(s).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the participants deliberately boost their creativity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the experiment, the musicians said they’d taken the instruction to heart: “I tried other things that I wouldn’t normally try”; “I felt totally freed. I felt like I’d been given license to go wherever my mind took me”; “I considered new elements of my performance while improvising with explicit instructions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for performers with fewer gigs behind them, this seemed to help: independent judges rated their improvisations as more proficient, aesthetically appealing, and creative, as compared to equivalent takes with no instructions. But more experienced musicians saw smaller benefits, with the effect for the most experienced players tipping (non-significantly in statistical terms) in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings add to past research showing that while mental control may be important for creativity, there is also a part to play for automatic, uncontrolled mental processes. For example, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and even brain damage to the frontal regions involved in executive function are both associated with heightened creativity. Mind-wandering and dreaming also seem to produce creative leaps. One explanation is that creativity is an interplay between automatic associative processes and deliberate effortful ones, or Type One and Type Two processes (as per Daniel Kahneman’s terminology). Freedom &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen in these terms, expert players may, over time, find their own balance of Type One and Two processes when improvising, such that conscious attention can’t easily lead to further improvements. In contrast, those with lower levels of mastery can find it productive to call on creative techniques intentionally or test out variants – “I wonder if I can try dropping different notes from an arpeggio run.” So for those of us not yet at the top of our creative game, making the conscious effort to focus on novel, creative outcomes might be the tactic to take us to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-14257-001/&quot;&gt;All You Need to Do Is Ask? The Exhortation to Be Creative Improves Creative Performance More for Nonexpert Than Expert Jazz Musicians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/heidelberg-1703363_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chromatin and Epigenetics EMBO conference is a biannual event that gathers together top speakers covering the latest advances in chromatin and epigenetics research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the front cover of the conference booklet was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wolffe&quot;&gt;Dr Alan Wolffe&lt;/a&gt; (1959-2001) a scientist who in the last three years of his life alone, published a number of articles on epigenetics including the role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression in normal and pathological states, chromatin remodeling in transcriptional repression and activation, and the molecular mechanisms of gene misregulation in disease, including cancer and Rett syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific programme was broadly along the same lines. It was organized into a number of sessions, namely chromatin regulation, developmental epigenetics, making and breaking heterochromatin, histone modifications, RNA and metabolism, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, nuclear architecture and remodelling chromatin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest was the series of talks on epigenetic reprogramming and regulation, including HOX genes regulation during vertebrate development, epigenetic reprogramming in mouse development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite was a fascinating talk on the &lt;strong&gt;role of epigenetic regulation on social behavior in ants&lt;/strong&gt;, describing work by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/p8678096&quot;&gt;Dr Roberto Bonasio&lt;/a&gt;  and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-9036 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/ant-954015_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Pixabay&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonasio explained how ant societies are very sophisticated, with different groups (or castes) arising from a single genome and having different roles. Each caste is distinct in appearance (morphology) and has different behavioral traits. Female embryos become &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_ant&quot;&gt;queens&lt;/a&gt; or one of a number of different types of worker ants. The developmental path of each individual ant is – strikingly – completely independent from their genetic makeup. The differences between each ant caste (their phenotype) must therefore be due to epigenetic modifications (i.e. not explained by changes in DNA sequence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonasio’s group have sequenced the genome for the ant species; &lt;em&gt;Camponotus floridanus&lt;/em&gt;, obtaining both genome-wide DNA methylation and chromatin structure profiles. Unlike for some other ant species, Harpegnathos queens can be replaced by worker ants, which then develop the behavioral and phenotypic traits of the queen. This unique behavior allows researchers to investigate the role of epigenetic pathways in regulating brain function and behavior. By obtaining the gene expression profiles of Harpegnathos ants before, during and after their transition from worker to queen, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide&quot;&gt;neuropeptide&lt;/a&gt; has been identified that that stimulates worker ant behaviors such as foraging while blocking the transition to queen status. This is exciting as it’s the first time a neuropeptide, and transcriptional regulation in general, is shown to play a role in caste determination and caste-specific behavior in a social organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other main highlights of the conference were, as expected, the two Keynote lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging the 3D organization of the genome and transcriptome in single cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zhuang.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Professor Xiaowei Zhuang&lt;/a&gt;, from Harvard University presented some super-resolution imaging and multiplex &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization&quot;&gt;fluorescent in situ hybridization&lt;/a&gt; (FISH) imaging methods developed in her laboratory that have produced high resolution images of the 3D conformation of chromatin in the cell nucleus. She demonstrated,  with the help of a collection of beautiful images,  how these methods have been used to, for example,  confirm that chromatin is organized into large contact domains called TADS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topologically_associating_domain&quot;&gt;topologically associating domains&lt;/a&gt;), but folding in a way that differs from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10577-010-9177-0&quot;&gt;classical fractal-globule model&lt;/a&gt; at large length scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MERFISH has helped map the distribution of RNA inside cells and distinct cell types in complex tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single-cell transcriptome imaging method called multiplexed error-robust FISH (&lt;a href=&quot;http://zhuang.harvard.edu/merfish.html&quot;&gt;MERFISH&lt;/a&gt;) was also described,  Professor Zhuang presented a number of applications for the technique, including mapping the distribution of RNA inside cells and also distinct cell types in complex tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetics and Rett syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very last talk presented at the conference was one by &lt;a href=&quot;http://birdlab.bio.ed.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Professor Adrian Bird&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Edinburgh.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rett-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx&quot;&gt;Rett syndrome&lt;/a&gt; is a devastating autistic spectrum disorder that affects the development of female children; it is very rarely seen in males. Sufferers seem normal at first, with symptoms typically appearing around the age of 2 to 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Bird has discovered the cause of the disorder, mutations to the so-called Rett gene &lt;em&gt;MeCP2. &lt;/em&gt;He explained that the MeCP2 protein binds to DNA sites that can be chemically altered by DNA methylation, which has an effect on gene expression. Although other hypotheses do exist, it is thought that the primary function of the MeCP2 protein is to affect DNA methylation in such a way as to block transcription; this is supported by biochemical and genetic analyses of the protein and also by the number of different mutations to the gene that causes the condition. MeCP2-deficiency leads to the development of a number of serious neurological disorders, including, of course, Rett syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of the talk, however, was a very visual demonstration, using mice as models, that the disorder is potentially curable with the aid of videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video 1 shows a MeCP2-deficient mouse with Rett Syndrome like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video 2 shows the same mouse after MeCP2-replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Taken from the &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; YouTube channel – url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVUq5C9LS-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I would certainly recommend this conference to anyone with an interest in the field and I look forward to the programme in two years time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/earthworm-686593_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Para&quot; id=&quot;Par6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;em class=&quot;EmphasisTypeItalic&quot;&gt;The plough is one of the most ancient and most valuable of man’s inventions; but long before he existed the land was in fact regularly ploughed, and still continues to be thus ploughed by earth-worms. It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organised creatures.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para&quot; id=&quot;Par7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Darwin, &lt;em class=&quot;EmphasisTypeItalic&quot;&gt;The formation of vegetable mould through the actions of worms, with observations on their habits&lt;/em&gt;, pg. 313&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earthworms digging about in your back yard are members of a large, ubiquitous group with a deep evolutionary history. There are over 6000 earthworm species, found on all continents except Antarctica. Most earthworms dwell in soil, but many live in leaf litter, decaying logs and riverbanks, while some live in trees and even along the seashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthworms are major terrestrial ecosystem engineers and their economic impact is immense—earthworms turn over, aerate and drain soils, providing crucial assistance to farmers and gardeners, and compost-dwelling species are used to process food waste and animal manures. Aristotle recognized their importance as the “Intestines of the Earth”, and their reputation was burnished by Charles Darwin in &lt;em&gt;The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, a Chinese sage said “watch the earthworm, miss the eclipse”, implying that there are better things to observe. We might disagree, especially in the cases of bioluminescent earthworms, one of which (&lt;em&gt;Avelona ligra&lt;/em&gt;) was sampled for this project, wildly colored earthworms (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Archipheretima&lt;/em&gt; spp.), and those capable of remarkable feats of climbing, some found 40 meters up in French Guyana rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9057&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9057&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/A.ligra-impression-ps.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The bioluminescent worm &lt;em&gt;Avelona ligra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Marcel Koken&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their value, earthworms are generally ignored until they are needed for bait or become a problem. Approximately one-third of the earthworm species in North America have been introduced from Europe or Asia. Some have been introduced into northern forests, which have been free from earthworms since the end of the last ice age ~11,000 years ago. Many other species in these forests rely on a deep layer of decaying leaf material, and earthworms are uniquely adapted to disturb this material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although earthworms are among the most familiar and economically important groups of large invertebrates, their evolutionary history is not well understood. As part of a collaborative effort funded by the US National Science Foundation to study annelid phylogeny, we harnessed high-throughput DNA sequencing to generate transcriptomes for representatives of nearly all of the eighteen living earthworm families as well as several groups thought to be closely related to them and used these data to infer phylogenetic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9058&quot; style=&quot;width: 470px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9058&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Archipheretima-middletoni-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The colourful earthworm species &lt;em&gt;Archipheretima middletoni&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Sam James&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that the earthworm tree of life consists of two major branches, both with subgroups in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. One of these branches includes at least three families, two found in eastern North America and one in Madagascar. The other branch contains the vast majority of earthworm species—the northern subgroup includes Lumbricidae, comprising nearly all familiar European species, and the southern subgroup includes Megascolecoidea (a group represented on all southern landmasses plus much of North America), two large Neotropical families and a tropical African family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One long-standing question is whether the broad geographic distribution of earthworms is due to dispersal between continents (e.g., by rafting) or vicariance—riding the continents as they’ve drifted over several hundred million years—or a combination of these processes. We can use our phylogeny to assess the relative importance of these competing mechanisms, but to do so, we had to calibrate our phylogeny to the geological time scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthworms have left an impressive record of trace fossils, but it is difficult to determine which species made a particular set of fossilized burrows, since body fossils are extremely rare. However, earthworms and their relatives lay their eggs in cocoons, and sometimes these cocoons fossilize. Leech cocoon fossils are known from the late Triassic, 201 million years ago, which tells us not only the minimum age of leeches, but also the minimum age of the common ancestor of leeches and earthworms. We were able to use these fossils to calibrate our phylogeny and infer divergence dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9059&quot; style=&quot;width: 970px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9059&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Eisenia_cocoon.png&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;An earthworm cocoon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analyses reveal that the ancestor of all living earthworms probably lived over 209 million years ago, making earthworms about as old as mammals and dinosaurs. Our date estimates for the divergences between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere subgroups of the two major branches of earthworms fall between 178-186 million years ago, coinciding with the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea 180-200 million years ago and corroborating the hypothesis that continental breakup influenced early earthworm diversification. This also implies that earthworms likely inhabited Antarctica before the continent’s southward drift made it inimical to most terrestrial animal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our phylogeny also provides a robust framework for investigating several questions about earthworm evolution. At several points in the phylogeny, earthworms have transitioned from terrestrial to aquatic habitats and vice versa. Most species in Clitellata (the group that includes earthworms) are aquatic, so earthworm genomes may retain ancestral genes that enable transitions between habitats. Alternatively, certain features may have been reinvented at each habitat transition. We have begun to explore this question, and hope to investigate other aspects of earthworm gene and genome evolution in our future work.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Brain-Blue-1-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sociability and the medial prefrontal cortex &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be possible to run a normal existence without social life? Indeed, sociability is an important aspect for individuals and social interactions build our lives. In fact, social interaction enhances quality of life and improves the stability of communities. Impaired sociability is a classical symptom observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety and generalized fear. Interestingly, many studies have pointed to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area located in the ventromedial part of the frontal lobe, as a key region involved in the neural bases of sociability (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25727858&quot;&gt;Valk et al, 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25109665&quot;&gt;Treadway et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17714666&quot;&gt;Frith et al., 2007&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prelimbic cortex (PL) and the infralimbic cortex (IL), two subregions of the mPFC, have been strongly suggested to play an important role in the neural mechanisms underlying sociability as isolation rearing in rats results in impaired social behavior and structural modifications in the PL and IL. Isolation rearing is a neurodevelopmental manipulation that produces neurochemical, structural, and behavioral alterations in rodents that in many ways are consistent with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. In particular, it has been shown that isolation rearing can alter the volume of mPFC, the dendritic length and the spine density of pyramidal neurons. However, the detailed mechanisms involved in sociability disorders remain elusive and poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altered mPFC activity after isolation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent article published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0176740&quot;&gt;Plos ONE&lt;/a&gt; by Minami and colleagues aimed at measuring neural activity in the PL and IL of control and isolated rats during social interaction in order to determine whether there is neural activity related to social behavior in these areas. Experimentally, animals were divided equally into 2 groups at postnatal day (P) 21 and were housed either in groups (control, group-reared rats) or single-cage (isolation-reared rats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does isolation influence mPFC activity? To tackle this question, multiunit recording was used as technique to record neural activity in freely moving animals during social behavior testing. However, as stated by the authors, “&lt;em&gt;the conventional technique requires that the animal be tethered to recording instruments with a cable of electrical wires&lt;/em&gt;” and this technical aspect may not facilitate natural and spontaneous social behavior in rats. To overcome these issue, Minami and colleagues used a wireless telemetry system to record the neural activity of a pair of freely moving rats during social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviors in the social interaction test were categorized as &lt;em&gt;sole&lt;/em&gt; (rats behave separately from each other), &lt;em&gt;approaching&lt;/em&gt; (rat approaching the partner, reduction of distance), &lt;em&gt;contact&lt;/em&gt; (which includes social exploration, aggressiveness and defensiveness), and &lt;em&gt;leaving&lt;/em&gt; (rat leaving the partner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19357&quot; style=&quot;width: 410px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/social-behavior.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-19357&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/social-behavior-300x293.jpg&quot; width=&quot;410&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Examples showing the behavior of the rats during the social interaction test. A, B: Sole behavior. Rats are behaving separately. The rat (no mark on its back) is exploring around by itself at the lower left corner of the test box and the partner (a black mark on its back) is resting at the lower right corner (A). Both rats are walking along the wall (B). C, D: Approaching behavior. The rat (arrow) is approaching the partner (C), and the partner (arrow) is approaching the rat (D). E–G: Contact behavior. Rats are sniffing (E) and boxing (F) each other, and the rat (arrow) is pinning and biting the partner (G). H, I: Leaving behavior. The rat (arrow) is leaving the partner (H), and the partner (arrow) is leaving the rat (I).&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In control rats (non isolated ones) PL neurons showed increased firing rate during both approaching and contact behaviors, especially when the rat attacked the partner. In contrast to PL neurons, IL neurons showed increased firing only during leaving behavior. Several studies using electrophysiological recordings have shown that the increased firing of PL neurons is correlated with sustained fear, whereas the increased firing of IL neurons is correlated with the recall of extinction (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16420154&quot;&gt;Gilmartin and McEchron, 2005&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24231425&quot;&gt;Fitzgerald PJ et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about isolated animals? Is neuronal activity different during social interaction?&lt;strong&gt; “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isolation-reared rats showed an increased frequency and decreased duration of contact behavior in the present study. These results may be interpreted as that isolation-reared rats are interested in a novel partner but cannot continue contact behavior with the partner for a long period&lt;/em&gt;”, report the authors of the study. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been reported that isolation-reared animals show a decreased duration of sociability as well as a hyperactivity to novel stimuli. Details analysis of the results revealed that PL neurons were characterized by increasing firing during approaching and contact behaviors (as reported in non-isolated rats). Conversely, IL neurons in isolation-reared rats did not show increased firing during leaving behavior (as observed in control animals), indicating that the increased firing of IL neurons observed during leaving behavior in group-reared rats is suppressed by isolation rearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The present data demonstrate the neural activity of the PL and IL during social interaction and the influence of isolation rearing on this activity. The differential effects of isolation rearing on the neural activity of the PL and IL may be one of the neural bases of isolation-induced behavior&lt;/em&gt;”, conclude Akira Mitani, the senior investigator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further investigations are needed to fully understand the role of mPFC in sociability, perhaps paving the way to discovery of alternative solutions for neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/cancer-389921_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are the most effective and cost-efficient weapons that can be used to prevent (preventive vaccines) or cure (therapeutic vaccines) diseases caused by infectious agents or cancer cells. Usually, when one thinks about the word vaccine, the first thought that comes into the mind is related to an artificial administration of a stimulus that instructs the immune system to fight against the cause of a particular pathological state (the pathogen). However, in the case of cancer vaccines, the main view, still unknown to the majority of the people not working in the field,  is represented by the exploitation of the host’s immune system to treat or prevent cancer. The idea, however, dates back decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way a “traditional” vaccine works, a cancer vaccine can promote the eradication of malignant cells during their initial transformation from safe to harmful cells. This eradication process, commonly referred to as immune surveillance of tumors [1], is carried out by the immune system and, most of the time, it happens without any external intervention. Tumors are the result of a particular combination of factors related to genetic and epigenetic changes that enable immortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way a “traditional” vaccine works, a cancer vaccine can promote the eradication of malignant cells during their initial transformation from safe to harmful cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a completely undetectable process: during the transformation of a normal cell into a malignant one, foreign antigens (neo-antigens or, to be more specific, onco-antigens) are created;  these should render neoplastic cells visible by the immune system that can target them for elimination. Tumors cells, like every living organisms, want, nevertheless, to live. Hence, tumors try to become resistant and invisible to immune system attacks by developing multiple resistance mechanisms that include local immune evasion, induction of tolerance and systemic interference of T cell signaling. Besides, mimicking the metaphor of Darwin’s natural selection, immune recognition of cancer cells enforces a selective pressure on developing ones. This favors the development of less immunogenic and more apoptosis-resistant neoplastic cells, through a mechanism well known as immune editing [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that cancer cells are particularly good at evading any action from the immune system, most anti-cancer treatments are based on other means like surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Nowadays, however, it is clear that the various arms of the immune system play an essential role in protecting humans from cancer. After unsatisfactory efforts and explicit clinical failures, the field of cancer immunotherapy has received a significant boost, thanks mainly to the development in 2010 of an autologous cellular immunotherapy, sipuleucel-T, for the treatment of prostate cancer [3] and the approval of the anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab (2011) and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) antibodies (2014) for the treatment of melanoma [4]. These achievements have renovated the field and brought attention to the opportunities that immunotherapeutic approaches can offer [5,6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9070&quot; style=&quot;width: 248px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9070&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/syringe-30012_1280-238x300.png&quot; width=&quot;238&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The field of cancer immunotherapy has recently received a significant boost&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still, however, some difficulties to be overcome when developing effective immunotherapy strategies against cancer. The general lack of understanding of the mechanisms of immunization, the role of dendritic cells, the ability of cancer to induce tolerance, and the identification of the most suitable antigens to use are just some examples of how the development of effective strategies is still problematic [7-10]. There are several biotechnological methodologies, based on both&lt;em&gt; in silico&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; techniques, that study and suggest possible candidates for use in immunotherapies. However, they are not able, on their own, to quantify and analyze the immune system response globally. Moreover, there are now several computational techniques to predict T cell epitopes (and, to some extent, also B cell epitopes) [11,12]. Computational simulations may help in solving these issues, but these need to be integrated with the &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; molecular analyses [13,14]. So, a complete computational/biological pipeline that allow the best integration of  &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; methodologies may potentially  boost and improve cancer immunotherapy development and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the thematic series is to bring together the latest advances in both biological and computational research, looking broadly at the basic biological aspects of immunotherapy, emerging immunotherapies (both prophylactic and preventive) and different vaccination approaches. The novel, and, at the same time, established character of computation in immunology greatly improves and speeds-up the development of novel vaccination strategies, both therapeutic and preventive, against cancer. We welcome original research, methodology, software, and database article submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Fast-food-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes including increased consumption of high fat diets have caused a considerable rise in individuals who are overweight and obese in the past decades. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. These individuals have increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and cholesterol levels, leading to various other health complications. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 1 in 11 adults have diabetes, and 21% of the world’s population will be affected by diabetes by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several clinical trials have proposed the useful effects of lifestyle intervention for controlling obesity and diabetes, however, in many cases restoring the glycemic index to normal levels does not ameliorate diabetic complications. This has been attributed to “metabolic memory” or “legacy effect”. High glucose conditions induce long-term cellular changes which are not completely restored after normalizing glycaemia. Metabolic memory due to programing has been attributed to induced epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation which alter normal gene expression and cell function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3799-y&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  assessed the physiological and cellular effects of high caloric diet induced hyperglycemia followed by caloric restriction, a common approach of controlling obesity in accordance with metabolic memory in non-human primates. Skeletal muscle being the major site of glucose intake, was the tissue of interest for this study. We included 6 male rhesus macaques and put them on western style calorie dense diets for 6 months followed by a calorie restricted diet to 70% of their required caloric intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed that a high-fat diet increased body weight, blood glucose and caused insulin resistance in macaques and calorie restriction in the same animals returned these levels to normal but had only a partial effect on fat loss. Findings from our transcriptional analysis showed that high-fat diet reprograms the skeletal muscle to induce changes which persist even after calorie restriction. Genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling remained downregulated post high-fat diet and caloric restriction while those involved in extracellular matrix remodeling remained upregulated. We also suspect that changes in the inflammatory response induced by high fat diet might induce ROS-related stress and other metabolic pathway changes which adapts the skeletal muscle to high fat environment. Related to metabolic memory, we identified a major epigenetic modifier SETD7 to be expressed at reduced levels following calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve long term problems associated with obesity it is important to identify the changes it induces within the cell. Identification of these factors through our study as compared to other studies provides possible cellular changes within the cell which can be targeted through medical intervention in addition to lifestyle intervention to improve health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Four, as in the UK? Six or seven, as in Sweden? What about one?&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/53/5/815.html&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Psychology, &lt;/i&gt;children as young as 12-months-old can be taught to get better at focusing their attention – which may help with their acquisition of language, and other types of learning. This new study involved typical, healthy infants. But the findings could also be taken as support for the idea that interventions aimed at children showing problems with attention (who may go on to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, for example) can, and should, start at a very young age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24245&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on children aged four and over has found that training tasks designed to improve attentional control can lead to more general improvements in attention (so not just on the tasks used in training). But there hasn’t been much work on younger children, and the limited work that has been done hasn’t investigated whether any improvements last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaili Clarkson at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues, divided 48 boys and girls, all aged about one, into a training group and two control groups. Each child first completed a roughly 20-minute series of tests of attentional control. These included an evaluation of how long they took to predict the next letter in a ABABAB sequence, the number of times they had to look at picture of a child’s face before they learned to recognise it, as well as an evaluation of general attentiveness during the entire testing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training group then received a total of 95 minutes of training over five sessions, spaced out over about two weeks. While sitting on their parent’s laps, these infants were presented in each session with six different tasks that rewarded them if they focused on a target. For example, in one, if a child looked away from a moving butterfly (the target) to a distractor, the display froze, and only un-froze when the child again focused on the butterfly. Another task required the infants to work out (with animations given as rewards) when the target changed from an image of an elephant to a chicken, while, again, ignoring distractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the fifth training session, and then also six weeks later, the infants in all groups took the initial tests of attentional control again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after training, there were significant improvements in the training group’s sustained attention, compared with their initial scores. These infants were also faster at learning to recognise another child’s face and at sequence learning and general attentiveness. (The controls showed no significant improvements.) The trained children only failed to improve on one test: memory for an image that they had previously learned to recognise. (At this young age, short term memory capacity may be too weak to be trained, the researchers suggested.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarkson and her colleagues also found lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the trained infants, compared with the controls, during these post-training testing sessions. And they think this is important because it suggests that targeting attention skills may lead to improved self-regulation, and lower anxiety levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six weeks on, the trained infants’ improvements in general attentiveness and habituation to a face had gone, as had the reduction in their cortisol levels. However, although  improvements in their sustained attention had faded a little, they were still statistically significant, and the trained infants were still faster at learning sequences than they were initially, and in comparison with the control groups’ scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the relative brevity of the training, it’s not surprising that there was a loss of or deterioration in improvements after six weeks. For comparison, the work on attention training in older children has generally involved training periods of around 10 hours, over 20-25 sessions. Future work should investigate whether longer-term training of one-year-olds could boost and sustain the types of improvements seen right after training in this study – and whether there are wider ranging benefits for language learning and other aspects of development. “Given the evidence that cortical activation patterns are less localised and specialised early in development”, it’s likely that training one-year-olds would lead to more generalised improvements than in older children, the researchers suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So should parents be rushing off to train their infants’ attention? This study (and others) have found benefits in the short term, in the lab. But what real-world effects training might – or might not – bring is not yet clear.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Cristina Barrero-Sicilia's journal club session where she discusses the paper, &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1082-1&quot;&gt;Rapid gene isolation in barley and wheat by mutant chromosome sequencing (Sánchez-Martín et al. (2016))&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of causal mutations in barley and wheat is hampered by their
large genomes and suppressed recombination. To overcome these obstacles, we
have developed MutChromSeq, a complexity reduction approach based on flow
sorting and sequencing of mutant chromosomes, to identify induced mutations by
comparison to parental chromosomes. We apply MutChromSeq to six mutants each of
the barley Eceriferum-q gene and the wheat Pm2 genes. This approach
unambiguously identified single candidate genes that were verified by Sanger
sequencing of additional mutants. MutChromSeq enables reference-free forward
genetics in barley and wheat, thus opening up their pan-genomes to functional
genomics.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Liverpool-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for testing new medical interventions on a population, with their use increasing exponentially throughout the twentieth century up to the present day. With their increasing use and complexity, new challenges have emerged in regards to how RCTs are conducted. This congress brought together leaders in the field to discuss every aspect of the methodology of RCTs including trial design, data analysis and reporting of trial outcomes amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current issues and challenges &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of the three keynote talks, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p4930413&quot;&gt;Dr Susan Ellenberg&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Pennsylvania, considered the on-going challenges and the emerging issues of clinical trials in the twenty first century. The first published RCT of the modern era was conducted in 1948 and since then the RCT has undergone constant change and development. One example of this is increasing the complexity of a clinical trial by incorporating individualized treatments dependent on specific biomarkers present in certain members of the study population. However, this brings with it a range of issues including which diseases require individualized treatment, the ethics of pursuing targeted treatments over broad treatments and the cost of these more complex trials. Another issue discussed was how clinical research can be carried out in an emergency situation such as the Ebola outbreak of 2014. In order to both treat patients and also investigate the most effective treatments, clinical research should be implemented from the beginning of the response to ensure that answers are found as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9046&quot; style=&quot;width: 3811px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9046&quot; height=&quot;2681&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Keynote1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;3801&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Susan Ellenberg&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical trials in the age of big data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another huge development in medical research in the last few decades has been the proliferation of “big data”. One of the most ambitious projects aiming to use big data in healthcare research is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/&quot;&gt;Million Veteran Program&lt;/a&gt; (MVP) with one of the leaders, &lt;a href=&quot;http://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/652/john-gaziano-cardiovascular_medicine-boston&quot;&gt;Dr Michael Gaziano&lt;/a&gt;, delivering the second keynote talk. The project aims to enrol one million veterans and will store a range of information on each individual, including self-reported lifestyle data alongside biospecimens. This forms one of the most comprehensive data sets in the world and can be used to research human health and disease. The development of such a large data set has brought many challenges such as learning how to structure and phenotype the data to allow it to be used to answer specific research questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing of clinical trial data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more and more data being collected on individual participants in clinical research, another theme at the conference was data sharing to improve research efficiency. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/translational-medicine/staff/catrin-tudur-smith/&quot;&gt;Catrin Tudur Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/steff-lewis&quot;&gt;Steff Lewis&lt;/a&gt; led a very interesting invited session with contributors discussing how clinical trial data can be shared more effectively, how participants view data sharing, and what data sharing might look like in the future. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/editorial-staff/trish-groves&quot;&gt;Trish Groves&lt;/a&gt;, Editor in Chief of &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;, provided the point-of-view of the publisher and suggested that journals have a big part to play in encouraging the publication of anonymized data sets alongside trial results. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/about_us/senior_staff_profiles/matt_sydes/&quot;&gt;Matt Sydes&lt;/a&gt; of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit presented some of the challenges surrounding data sharing, including effective anonymization of the data as well as deciding which data sets are worth preparing for sharing as this can be a time consuming and costly process. The importance of data security was also covered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/profile/400/1451/gillian_booth&quot;&gt;Gillian Booth&lt;/a&gt; as well as the importance of obtaining appropriate consent for data sharing from the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK NIHR Health Technology Assessment Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final keynote was delivered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/hywel.williams&quot;&gt;Professor Hywel Williams&lt;/a&gt; who spoke about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding-and-support/funding-for-research-studies/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment/&quot;&gt;UK NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme&lt;/a&gt; which is one of the largest UK funding bodies of clinical trials, with results directly influencing clinical practice in the NHS. One of the main aims of the program is to conduct timely research to answer specific questions that are required to improve current clinical practice. This is done through a prioritization process to determine which research projects are most needed and are generally those that are important to the NHS, are supported by current evidence, are feasible and that are clear and well defined. One of the take home messages was that the program aims to strike a balance between influencing the research community and also being led by the research community in terms of deciding which projects should be funded.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contract manufacturing of pharmaceuticals is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://resultshealthcare.com/insight/pharma-biotech-2017/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;growing rapidly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and has recently seen an uptick in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/05/15/patheon-stock-thermo-fisher/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;merger and acquisition activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, such as Thermo Fisher’s bid to acquire Patheon.  Despite the consolidation, outsourced pharmaceutical manufacturing remains a fragmented market, as outlined in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://resultshealthcare.com/insight/pharma-biotech-2017/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;recent report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outsourcedpharma.com/doc/m-a-crucible-in-contract-drug-development-and-manufacturing-0001?vm_tId=1990990&amp;amp;user=2ef1f69e-200b-45fb-8201-50dde0ac0940&amp;amp;utm_source=et_6214173&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=OUTPH_04-05-2017&amp;amp;utm_term=2ef1f69e-200b-45fb-8201-50dde0ac0940&amp;amp;utm_content=M%2526amp%253bA+Crucible+in+Contract+Drug+Development+And+Manufacturing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Discovering and qualifying outsourced service providers is already challenging, and the persistent fragmentation compounds the challenges. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange has a unique vantage point for evaluating contract manufacturing services based on our diverse client base and the associated customer experience scorecard data we gather. In this post, we share our insights around navigating the complex contract manufacturing sector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demand for contract manufacturing services&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The high demand for external manufacturing capacity and expertise is one driving force behind the proliferation of CMOs and CDMOs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niceinsight.com/articles.aspx?post=3058&amp;amp;title=Strong+CMO/CDMO+Market+Outlook+for+2016,+but+Beware+Moderating+Factors&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2016 survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, biopharma organizations cite the need to improve quality as the primary reason for using contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs). Additional goals for outsourcing include reducing time to market, controlling costs, achieving supply chain diversity, leveraging regulatory expertise, and accessing specialized technologies, including those required for complex biologics manufacturing processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition between CMOs: Innovative manufacturing services&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Competition in the marketplace is driving CMOs to develop innovative manufacturing technologies to capture new service categories — choosing a cutting-edge CMO partner can give a biopharma company advantages over its competitors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many CMOs and CDMOs have adopted process improvements to provide their clients with faster cycle times and more informed decision-making. These improvements include cloud-based computing, real-time risk-monitoring tools, and integrated quality-by-design during process development. Suc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;h process improvements are especially important given &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the ability of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://resultshealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;multiple CMOs to manufacture the same API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Nearly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://resultshealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Results-Healthcare_Pharma-Biotech-2017-Review-of-outsourced-manufacturing_Whitepaper.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;90%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of the volume of drugs sold are generic small molecule therapeutics, requiring high production capacity that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;may be provided by any number of CMOs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Other CMOs differentiate themselves through specialized expertise – for example, they may be leaders in developing novel formulations, such as nanoparticles or lipid-based delivery systems. Some CMOs offer specialized regulatory certifications, such as CLIA/CAP, GLP, and GCP. Although cGMP compliance is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcisynthesis.com/how-to-get-your-organization-prepared-for-an-fda-inspection/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;not absolutely required for all CMO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;s, most reputable CMOs are cGMP certified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contract manufacturing of biologics and complex therapeutics: a growth opportunity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Upstream-Processing/Biologics-CMO-demand-to-drop-as-Big-Pharma-favours-in-house-capacity&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;challenging to outsource the manufacture of biologics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, such as vaccines, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and cell therapies, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyas.org/Events/Detail.aspx?cid=07082904-d593-4f0e-ada7-446ec8e7444b&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;non-biological complex drugs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. These fast-growing segments are fac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ed with regulatory hurdles, a need for specialized drug delivery devices, and inherent risks involved in method transfer and ensuring consistent supply. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Despite the challenges of method transfer, technological improvements are facilitating partnerships between biopharma companies and CMOs in biologics pipelines. Emerging categories of therapeutics, such as cell therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, as well as novel formulations, such as nanoparticles, have benefited from specialized manufacturers. Even though some of these specialty drug products may require bespoke manufacturing processes, CMOs stay agile through integrated quality-by-design during process development and take advantage of connected single-use technologies for streamlined yet flexible bioprocessing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barriers facing discovery and qualification of manufacturing service providers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The demand for contract manufacturing, combined with the growth opportunities around innovation and biologics, have resulted in a marketplace with thousands of active CMOs and CDMOs. It can be time-consuming and difficult to identify qualified service providers with the right certifications to meet regulatory compliance requirements. Though many service providers are staffed by innovative, highly qualified scientists with experience in the biopharma industry, many service providers lack such expertise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Because there are no clear third-party qualification processes or objective benchmarks for quality, and because biopharma companies lack the time to perform regulatory compliance audits of all the service providers in this fragmented sector, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niceinsight.com/articles.aspx?post=3058&amp;amp;title=Strong+CMO/CDMO+Market+Outlook+for+2016,+but+Beware+Moderating+Factors&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;over 68% of biopharma companies use a preferred provider strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for outsourced manufacturing. Relying on preferred providers may decrease the agility of companies to take advantage of emerging technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For contract manufacturing to add maximum value to an organization, responsible teams should consider adhering to a defined sourcing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Checklist for a successful contract manufacturing partnership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To maximize the advantages offered by a successful CMO partnership, the procurement and external resource management teams of a biopharma company must ensure that their sourcing strategy includes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Keeping abreast of emerging technologies and service providers;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Stringently qualifying service providers based on turnaround time, product quality, cost, and regulatory compliance;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Identifying service gaps and assessing value of existing preferred providers; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Streamlining the contracting process to enable rapid onboarding of innovative service providers;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Establishing contracts that protect intellectual property and confidentiality, to maintain competitive advantage and minimize risk;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Managing project milestones to ensure that projects are completed on time and as planned;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Keeping meticulous records so that methods can be transferred in house or to other service providers as needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) regulates glucose homeostasis through the control of insulin release from the pancreas. GLP-1 peptide agonists are efficacious drugs for the treatment of diabetes. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of GLP-1 peptides, here we report the crystal structure of the full-length GLP-1 receptor bound to a truncated peptide agonist. The peptide agonist retains an α-helical conformation as it sits deep within the receptor-binding pocket. The arrangement of the transmembrane helices reveals hallmarks of an active conformation similar to that observed in class A receptors. Guided by this structural information, we design peptide agonists with potent in vivo activity in a mouse model of diabetes.

 Cpf1 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that is emerging as a powerful genome-editing tool. Here we provide insight into its DNA-targeting mechanism by determining the structure of Francisella novicida Cpf1 with the triple-stranded R-loop generated after DNA cleavage. The structure reveals the machinery involved in DNA unwinding to form a CRISPR RNA (crRNA)–DNA hybrid and a displaced DNA strand. The protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is recognized by the PAM-interacting domain. The loop-lysine helix–loop motif in this domain contains three conserved lysine residues that are inserted in a dentate manner into the double-stranded DNA. Unzipping of the double-stranded DNA occurs in a cleft arranged by acidic and hydrophobic residues facilitating the crRNA–DNA hybrid formation. The PAM single-stranded DNA is funnelled towards the nuclease site through a mixed hydrophobic and basic cavity. In this catalytic conformation, the PAM-interacting domain and the helix–loop–helix motif in the REC1 domain adopt a ‘rail’ shape and ‘flap-on’ conformations, respectively, channelling the PAM strand into the cavity. A steric barrier between the RuvC-II and REC1 domains forms the ‘septum’, separating the displaced PAM strand and the crRNA–DNA hybrid, avoiding DNA re-annealing. Mutations in key residues reveal a mechanism linking the PAM and DNA nuclease sites. Analysis of the Cpf1 structures proposes a singular working model of RNA-guided DNA cleavage, suggesting new avenues for redesign of Cpf1.

 Expansions of short nucleotide repeats produce several neurological and neuromuscular disorders including Huntington disease, muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A common pathological feature of these diseases is the accumulation of the repeat-containing transcripts into aberrant foci in the nucleus. RNA foci, as well as the disease symptoms, only manifest above a critical number of nucleotide repeats, but the molecular mechanism governing foci formation above this characteristic threshold remains unresolved. Here we show that repeat expansions create templates for multivalent base-pairing, which causes purified RNA to undergo a sol–gel transition in vitro at a similar critical repeat number as observed in the diseases. In human cells, RNA foci form by phase separation of the repeat-containing RNA and can be dissolved by agents that disrupt RNA gelation in vitro. Analogous to protein aggregation disorders, our results suggest that the sequence-specific gelation of RNAs could be a contributing factor to neurological disease.
